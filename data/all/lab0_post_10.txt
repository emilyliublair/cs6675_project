Question: 
    ls fails for newly created directoriesAfter I create a directory (either through a user program or from the shell viamkdir), every time I attempt to calllsfor that directory, it fails.Example:$ ls(Regular ls output for /)$ mkdir tmp$ ls /tmpexec: failexec ls failed$ cd tmp$ lsexec: failexec ls failedI'm kind of curious why this happens. Looking briefly intols.cit seems like there might be some permission issues?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    Try ../ls.I think it's because the ls executable is only in the main directory and not directly accessible when you traverse down the file tree. This should execute the ls executable from one directory down.~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
