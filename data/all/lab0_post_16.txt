Question: 
    malloc vs sbrkWhen testing both sbrk and malloc for finding the maximum memory size in xv6, is it expected that both approaches yield the same final output? If not, why does sbrk yield a higher memory limit compared to malloc? Could this discrepancy be attributed to the metadata overhead or other differences in memory management between the two methods?lab0
