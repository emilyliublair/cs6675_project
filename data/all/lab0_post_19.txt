Question: 
    Maximum number of files per directory: panicI think I am asking the same question ashttps://piazza.com/class/m5l90em6d0u656/post/36There was a shared student answer that states that we can print out our number of files as we are trying to find it. But I am getting a panic that makes my xv6 instance unusable (lapicid 0: ialloc: no inodes). Should I be hitting this? I am using open() to create all the files, is there something else that I should use that won't cause this panic? Any help would be appreciated :) thankslab0
