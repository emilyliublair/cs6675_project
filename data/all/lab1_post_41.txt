Question: 
    Running the `backtrace` function from xv6-qemu consoleThis may be a dumb question, but I'm not sure how to run `backtrace` from my xv6-qemu console for testing purposes. In Lab0 I was able to run user-space programs by just typing them into my console (like `helloworld arg1 arg2`), but this isn't working for kernel-space programs like `backtrace`. For context, I've placed my C file `backtrace.c` in the `kernel/src` directory. Getting the following error when I try to run it:$ backtraceexec: failexec backtrace failedDo I have to create a user-space program that calls `backtrace`, or is there a simpler fix that I'm overlooking? Thanks in advance.lab1

    @83_f1Rohan Natansh Bafna3 months agoIn what situations have you run your backtrace function? There are multiple entry points to the kernel; _start is one, when the first CPU of the system boots up, but there are other ways in which execution can enter kernel space. Have you tested against them all?(oops, this was supposed to be an answer lol)good comment0Anonymous Gear3 months agoI've been using system calls and as far as I can tell, the output looks reasonable.Putting backtrace() in kernel main() panics on a user return address with the last values being:ebp = 0x801380d8Return Address = 0x0The ebp value seems valid so I'm not sure how to handle this correctly0Rohan Natansh Bafna3 months agoI would suggest using gdb to figure out what's going on. Set a breakpoint at the beginning of backtrace, and double check the values of ebp and the return addresses you see as you walk the stack with the contents of the stack itself. You'll find thexcommandparticularly helpful; it dumps a region of memory as raw bytes to the console.You can also cross reference your findings with the disassembly of the xv6 kernel at build/kernel/kernel.asm to see what exact instructions are executed at the beginning of main and at the beginning of backtrace that would set up the stack.good comment2Anonymous Helix3 months agoI am also dealing with the exact same issue now. :(0@83_f2Shourik Banerjee3 months agoHow can I understand if my output makes sense or not? The names I get match up and I don't know if there's any way for me to tell if the offsets are correct or if the return addresses I'm getting are correct. I'm also pretty sure that my output format is correct.Inside the mpmain function, the output of backtrace is:<0x801043ed> mpmain+12<0x801043c7> mpenter+00Rohan Natansh Bafna3 months agoYou can check the addresses against the disassembled kernel at build/kernel/kernel.asm; you should see a call instruction at each location you print, within the right function.good comment0Shourik Banerjee3 months agoIs the address I want the start of this line?8010441f:    e8 9f c9 ff ff           call   80100dc3 <backtrace>I seem to be getting the address of this line, where it refers to the call right after the previous line.80104424:    e8 0e 09 00 00           call   80104d37 <cpuid>I just want to make sure that I want the address from the <backtrace> line instead of the one after it, or if the one after it is actually the one I want.EDIT:Never mind, my issue was not printing the line "Backtrace\n" at the start.1Anonymous Poet3 months agoSo in this case, the address that you are printing is 0x80104424 right?0
