Question: 
    QEMU frozen at boot when giving it more than 2G of RAMI’m running into this strange bug where whenever I tell QEMU to boot with 2GB or more RAM using the-moption, it just gets stuck on “Booting from Hard Disk…” indefinitely. Any value under 2GB does not trigger the issue, and my code is running fine - a correct value is detected for any amount of RAM I throw at it. Could this be a bug in qemu or Docker?lab1
