Question: 
    Running Usertests.cHow can I run usertest.c? Is it ran from inside xv6? When I run 'ls' inside xv6, I cannot see it, nor do I see a usertests executable in the build directory.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    Ended up figuring it out. You add usertests.c and echo.c to the CMakeLists.txt and make. When you ls, you should see it there now.
