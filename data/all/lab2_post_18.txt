Question: 
    Passing forktest and all usertests but autograder times outWe are currently matching the expected output for forktest and all the usertests pass, however, when we submit to autograder it times out for every test. Additionally, when we make the project in release mode, the boot fails with a panic for an unexpected trap 6. Anyone have any issues similar to this? Thankslab2

    @304_f1Anonymous Gear2 months agoI can't remember if this was the exact output, but I do know that after everything you run there should be a PGTRAP on the $ line in a working solution. I think it should be okay2
