Question: 
    Getting a random PGTRAP at va 0x19a0 after every commandWhenever I run a command like `ls` or `usertets`, I get this random PGTRAP after my output prints. I debugged this a little with GDB and it looks like it's from an attempted write to the guard page (0x19a0 maps to the guard page). I do prevent the guard page from being written in `trap.c`, but wondering if this condition should ever even be reached in a working process? Is this PGTRAP normal or an indication that I'm doing something wrong. Thanks!lab2
