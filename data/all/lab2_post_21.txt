Question: 
    Do we need to call lab2_pgzero on the global zero page?We are currently creating our zero page as an array of zeros in our vm.c rather than by allocating a page and zeroing it, so we are not calling lab2_pgzero for the initial page. Would this result in any problems with the autograder?lab2
