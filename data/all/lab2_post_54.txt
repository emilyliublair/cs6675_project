Question: 
    Forktest PGTRAP: err 0x4I'm getting repeated err=4 after process 7 print of forktest with my current COW implementation. Err=4 is 100 or basically the user is accessing an read only virtual address that doesn't exist. I assumed it was a TLB issue, but I can't really tell what is happening or why this is going on. Currently if I check myproc() on gdb on the error, I see that I'm actually in PID 5.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    It could be that you are updating your PTE too early or not invalidating TLB

    @244_f1Anonymous Mouse2 months agoAre you facing this issue while trying to implement part 2 (lazy zero page allocation)? I'm having the same issue, can't seem to figure out what's causing it but something that seems relevant is the fact that the value of my instruction pointer in my trap frame is 0x0, which is definitely not right0Rohan Natansh Bafna2 months agoIt could be right. Since programs in xv6 are loaded at the bottom of the address space, 0 usually points to executable code, and oftentimes it points directly to main, which makes 0 the elf entry point.good comment1
