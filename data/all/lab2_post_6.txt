Question: 
    Refcount spinlockI have a question about when to acquire and release the spinlock for refcount in CoW. I feel like we have normally been taught to acquire right before the access and release right after, however, I feel like there could be a scenario where accessing and writing to refcount in separate locks could lead to another process using the wrong refcount value, so maybe I should only use one spinlock that is acquired at the beginning of CoW and released at the end? But at the same time, I can't think of a specific scenario in which this would happen, so I'm not sure if this is an actual concern.lab2
