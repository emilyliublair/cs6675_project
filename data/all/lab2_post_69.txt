    Instructor Answer: 
    You will have to define it yourself if you want to read cr3. xv6 doesn’t have a function defined for it.On whether its needed or not… think about and maybe even walk through how a virtual address gets converted to a physical address in paging. Can you extract the page directory given the faulting address (which is in cr2)?
