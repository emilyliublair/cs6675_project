Question: 
    odd behavior on bootup:I am getting this issue during bootup trying to implement copy on write. The weird thing is that it seems that the only thing that prints out this PGTRAP line is lab2_report_pagefault() and the only place that I call this is in my trap handler for page faulting. But after I get that initial error in bootup, my kernel kinda just spirals into this without ever hitting my break point in my trap handler. I am assuming that my bootup is going wrong because my second PGTRAP va is at 0x0 and not 0x2fcc like the expected output file. Any ideas on how to proceed and debug this?lab2
