Question: 
    How to break in init.c?GDB seems to not allow me to break in init.c. When I do `b init.c:23` to break within the loop it says it isn't defined and if I say yes to trigger it on future library load it still never triggers. Is there a way to solve this?lab2

    I don’t think you’ll ever need that extra functionality, but feel free to do so if you wish.
