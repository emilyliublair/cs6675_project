Question: 
    Is waitpid() required to pass 1-21?It is listed under part 2, but the rubric says it isn’t tested until test 37.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    yes <---- not true btw

    Instructor Answer: 
    You need to have the waitpid syscall defined, i.e., it should be possible tocompilea call to waitpid() from user space. If you don’t do this, you will get a make failure and the autograder will not give any results.But we don’t test waitpid outside of test 37.
