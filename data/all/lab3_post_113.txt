Question: 
    Clone restarting OS (xv6)I am running into an issue with clone where it restarts the OS (xv6) after I call it. I've gdb'd through clone and it all looks normal (as far as I can reasonably tell - something is definitely wrong, though). Did anyone else run into this issue?Some quick info:I call clone through the system call I made in user spaceThe arguments for the system call are being passed through correctlyClone completely executes, and the file where I call clone() (I just commented everything out in main() of workload and added the clone test) also completely executes.Ex: main() { [clone test] printf(1, "test complete") ... exit()} prints "test complete" - indicating that clone finished executing.I call clone the same way fork is called (plus the arguments needed for the stack pointer and size)When I say "restarts the OS", I mean that I briefly see my print statement ("test complete") show up, and then it clears with the Booting from hard disk..xv6... and all that with the blank shell. I can then run anything from shell and it all is as expected (with running the file with clone re-restarting the OS every time as well). It is exactly as if I just ran ./xv6-qemu.lab3
