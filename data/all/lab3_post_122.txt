    Instructor Answer: 
    I’m assuming we shouldn’t though because if one thead closes the file then it should remove the file entirely assuming there are no other process outside the threadgroup which access it which won’t happen if the ref count is higher than 1.This logic is correct. Semantically speaking, they share the “same” reference.
