Question: 
    Extra Credit time measurements off-by-one?If a process starts and ends within the same timeslice (i.e. before the timer interrupts), is the execution time 1 or 0? If we count it as 1 then sometimes the response time != execution + wait + io, but otherwise, having an execution time of 0 doesnâ€™t seem right.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    That would not be necessary, since what we care about is time spent on the CPU not necessary time spent in exec.
