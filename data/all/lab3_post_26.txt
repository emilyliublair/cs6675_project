    @571_f1Nathan Prashant Duggal3 weeks agoIf the exit is called from a thread which isnt the thread group owner, because the cwd may be used by the owner or other threads, the iput shouldnt even be called at all, right? The other case is the exit being called on a thread group owner, in which case the behavior is undefined anyways, so you probably dont need to lock then either.0Shourik Banerjee3 weeks agoYeah realized this in the other thread I made. I'm curious if there's anything with the other iput call. As far as I see locking before that one hasn't broken anything for me, but idk, maybe if you test extensively it would?0Nathan Prashant Duggal3 weeks agoWhat is the other iput?0Shourik Banerjee3 weeks agoIn sys_chdir0Nathan Prashant Duggal3 weeks ago@520Probably have to in some capacity.0Shourik Banerjee3 weeks agoYeah I lock there and it doesn't sched lock as far as I can tell so it's probably okay to lock there0
