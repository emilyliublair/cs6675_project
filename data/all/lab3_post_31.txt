Question: 
    Test Cases 25-30I'm having an issue with my clone method where it doesn't return 0 in the child. I haven't been able to fix it yet and this causes me to fail test case 12. I'm also failing 26-30. I was wondering if it's possible to pass 26-30 even with my issue in clone. I don't want to burn submissions if this won't work.lab3

Wait has to acquire and release a mutex, and also makes it a call that makes it sleep.0Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoHow do you use cond? We literally just use it as a pointer for the chan in park.0Anonymous Calc3 weeks agoI had a conditional variable in the struct, but I didn't use any pointers to the channel since chan is just any void*0Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoAlso should we consider the case where the mutex is not held when calling cond_wait? Like it should not wait if the mutex is not held?0Anonymous Calc3 weeks agoThey don't test for it in the autograder but I'm not sure0
