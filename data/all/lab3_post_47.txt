Question: 
    Weird bug where Test Case 7 occasionally doesn't pass the autograderI was wondering if there is any particular behavior that causes this inconsistency. I'm pretty sure the scheduler implementation is correct because it passes 7 about 9/10 times we submit on gradescope. I was wondering if it was a potential locking issue, but as far as I know we didn't need to use our own locks for scheduler (only ptable which I'm pretty sure is correct).lab3
