Question: 
    Autograder timeoutMy submission has been running in the autograder for almost 30 minutes. I figure one of the testcases is stick in a loop or something but I have never had the autograder run this long before. When I previously had hard fault or timeout issues the autograder usually ended after 7-8 minutes. Has the timeout been extended or is this a glitch?lab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    By starved do you mean a user thread tried to acquire a spinlock but never does because another thread that has the lock never releases? This livelock is an issue of the userland programmer. It should be sufficient to ensure mutual exclusion.
