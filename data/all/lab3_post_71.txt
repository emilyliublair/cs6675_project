Question: 
    What is the point of thread_wait()?Mine is just a 1 line wrapper around waitpid(), and it passed all thread library cases from 22-31 (multiple times to ensure I didnâ€™t get lucky because of a race condition).Why not just call the syscall directly?  thread_create() at least provides some value by allocating a extra stack but thread_wait() does nothing. What am i missing?lab3
