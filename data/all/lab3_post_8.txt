Question: 
    Tests 5 and 10Does anyone know what tests 5 and 10 test for? I am passing every other test except for those two. Things I have done:Changing the priority / scheduler of a child to preempt current processChanging the priority / scheduler of current process to preemptYielding after timer interrupt only if its RRChecking if there is a better process to run at timer interrupt if its FIFOUsing arrival time to order FIFOI heard that test 5 checks for decreasing your current priority to preempt, but from all my own tests, my code displays this functionality.lab3
