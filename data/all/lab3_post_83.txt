Question: 
    Part 4 Spinlock keeping track of lock ownerDo we need to keep track of the process/thread that is holding a lock (especially to make sure that you're calling release only if you hold the lock)? If so, any tips to keep track of who is holding the lock since pid is not accessible from user space?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    You can use the getpid() syscall to get the PID of the current process in user space.~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~

    @462_f1Anonymous Gear4 weeks agoHey, I'm stuck on these exact test cases too and I'm just a bit lost on where to start. Wondering if you have any pointers just to get me moving in the right direction.I've made a couple changes to clone and got 26 and 28 to pass, but no other luck. Any help would be awesome thanks!0Anonymous Mouse4 weeks agoIf a thread does any of the following, you need to propagate the relevant changes to the entire thread group:modifying the file descriptor tablechanging working directorychanging the amount of memory allocated to the process (theszfield of theprocstruct needs to be consistent across all threads in a thread group)Think about how you could update all the threads in a thread group when one of those scenarios occur. Once you have that figured out, you should make sure you’re accounting for all the places where those changes could happen. When you’re propagating the changes, you should also make sure you use locks in the appropriate places.2Anonymous Scale4 weeks agoHey, I'm also stuck in the same test cases including 28. Wondering if you could point me in the right direction how you fixed 28, thanks!0Anonymous Gear4 weeks agoUnfortunately, we never failed 28. I have no clue why we passed it. I'm sorry dawg.0Anonymous Beaker3 weeks agoThanks for the advice, made some helper functions to do the work and i was able to pass 26-30.0Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoDo we need to actually propagate these changes for the cases to work or will it work if we just update the thread group owner and maintain a reference. I'm asking because thats how I'm doing it right now but it seems like thats not the way the test is written.0Anonymous Beaker3 weeks agoWell, for reference, i tried only updating the group owner but seems like that doesn't work, after i propagated those changes i was able to pass all of 26-300Anonymous Scale3 weeks agoDid you have timeout/hardfault or incorrect output when they failed?0Anonymous Beaker3 weeks agoincorrect output for 28 and hardfault for the rest0
