    @452_f1Sukrit Kumar1 month agoAre you using thread groups (+locks) to control access to all the shared resources ?Also try looking at using waitpid as well that might help issues with clone and when the thread group owner is exitinggood comment0Shourik Banerjee1 month agoWe are, we don't use wait nor waitpid in our testing code so not sure if that's the issue. It kind of just loops and creates clones and if the clone was created, it'll immediately exit. Maybe on the last iteration or something the parent manages to exit first?0
