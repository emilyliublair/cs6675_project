Question: 
    Triple Fault for Clone when sharing files (sometimes)Currently, I have a version of clone that runs about 90% of the time. We are using locks for a shared file data structure. However, sometimes, when running local tests involving clone, a triple fault occurs. This only occurs sometimes.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    Are you using waitpid? If not is it possible that the parent thread is exiting and freeing the kstack causing the os to reboot or triple fault?

    @451_f1Anonymous Atom1 month agoIt has something to do with the fact that a process or its parent modifies priority such that it should become the new process to run. Make sure you preempt when a new process becomes the best one.0Erel Ozen1 month agoI thought this was test case 9?0Loading...1 month agoI think:Test case 9 checks whether the current process has had its priority decreased (and if a better process should preempt it).Test case 5 checks whether the modified process's priority is now greater than the current process (and so preempt the current process).~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) thinks this is a good comment ~1
