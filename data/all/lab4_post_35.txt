Booting from Hard Disk..xv6...
cpu0: starting 0
sb: size 1000 nblocks 941 ninodes 200 nlog 30 logstart 2 inodestart 32 bmap start 58For context, I have passed all tests for Part 1 and Part 2 (1-17) along with unintentionally passing tests 18,20,24,25. I have also rungdbwithlogin_init.cset as the file, andlogin-xv6-qemudoes not reach the file before freezing.xv6-qemuworks perfectly fine though.lab4
