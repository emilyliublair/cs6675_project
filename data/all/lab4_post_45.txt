Question: 
    Invalid revision range errorI'm trying to run submit.sh and am getting the following error, not sure whylab4

    Student Answer:

    Instructor Answer: 
    1. sys_fstat takes in a file as an argument. You will only have a valid file if it was opened using another syscall like sys_open. You can see how this works in user/src/ls.c. This means sys_open should handle the permissions.2. Yes3. Not sure where this would apply. Feel free to follow up below.
