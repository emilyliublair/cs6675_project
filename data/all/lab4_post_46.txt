    Questions on PermissionsIs sys_fstat considered a read?Is sys_link considered a read from the source file, apart from being a read/write to the target parent directory?Also, if the inode has no read permissions, can we access the other members of the inode, or is it just that we can’t access the data (as a different uid)?lab4

    @647_f1Anonymous Helix1 week agoStuck on the same test case - please let me know if you make any progress. For what it's worth, I was passing this case before I implemented get_free_blocks, so it might be something to do with that - either get_free_blocks itself or the fact that our design choice is wrong and is causing bad metrics to be calculated0@647_f2Anonymous Comp1 week agoSame here, only failing this test case0@647_f3Anonymous Comp1 week agoJust passed it, it was because the blocks weren’t freed up correctly. Look over itrunc.2Anonymous Gear1 week agoThanks a lot!0
