Question: 
    Varun’s OH 2/11 CancelledHey everyone,Apologies for the late notice, but I’ll be cancelling my OH today because I came down with something overnight and have a bad headache this morning. I’ll be available offline over Piazza to answer any questions. I will try to host makeup OH later in the week if possible.-Varunlogistics
