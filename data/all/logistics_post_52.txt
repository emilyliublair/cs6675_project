Question: 
    Language ServerWhat setup are you all using to edit code? Is anyone using NeoVim? If so, has anyone gotten their LSP to work? I've tried using CCLS and Clang. Neither is working. Seems to be an issue with my build commands.logistics

    Student Answer: 
    I recently got clangd set up to the point where I can do stuff without everything yelling at me lol.What kind of issues are you facing?

    Instructor Answer: 
    Can you try re-uploading? It was probably a glitch
