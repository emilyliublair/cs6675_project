A lot of encryption algorithms use a key for encryption, so the different encryption would be done via providing a different key.0Ashwin Amitabh Mudaliar5 days agoThe salts are stored but they are of little use - you've already storedhash(salt+password), and it is very unlikely that a rainbow table entry exists for this salt + password combination. On your implementation, forgive me if I'm incorrect, but you'd have to store the key as well right?0
