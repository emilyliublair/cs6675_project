Question: 
    Lecture 24 user space file persistence exampleIn lecture 24, the example given for persisting a write to a file has the metadata change being persisted to the log before the block write, but I thought you had to write to the data block before persisting the metadata change in the log in an ordered log system.midtermlab4

    Instructor Answer: 
    Thank you, Erin for your question. Will it help if I release a video recording of a distributed systems lecture on Monday? As I am attempting to prepare this class for exam 2, the choice I faced was to give ordering and atomicity a limited treatment last week, so that we get to Distributed Systems on Thursday OR give you full, detailed coverage of ordering and atomicity, focusing on students' complete understanding of this large module. It was a tradeoff, and I picked a Pareto-optimal point ;)I can offer the following options to alleviate your concern:I can try to release my last year's video recording of the distributed systems lecture today, Sun, 4/13I can release a newly recorded video of the distributed systems lecture, tomorrow, Mon, 4/14I can walk through distributed systems in person on Tuesday, 4/15We can drop Distributed Systems from the list of topics covered on exam 2. I will lecture on Distributed Systems on Thursday, 4/17 (AFTER exam2).What will be the most helpful?Thank you,ATUPDATE: option 1 above has already been executed.UPDATE 2: we're going with option 4: no distrib. systems on exam 2!

    @694_f1Anonymous Mouse5 days agoI think a newly recorded video of the distributed systems lecture would also be helpful, as I'm finding it incredibly difficult to study for a topic that hasn't been explicitly covered in lecture. Last year's recording is appreciated, but I still feel like we are at an unfair disadvantage being asked questions about distributed systems without actually having class time to learn about it because now, in addition to studying for the exam, we have to learn and understand entirely new content.0Alexey Tumanov3 days agoPlease see@709_f1good comment0
