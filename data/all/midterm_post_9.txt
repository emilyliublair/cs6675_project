    Exam 2 review lecture, mem/data block sizes and swappingIt was noted that mem page size == file data block size due to swapping, this makes sense for the most part, but why is this better than file data block size = 2 * mem page size? What are the implications on swapping in this case?midterm~ An instructor (Alexey Tumanov) endorsed this question ~
