Question: 
    movl    $(V2P_WO(entrypgdir)), %cr3  VS %eaxIn entry.S when we are transferring the physical address of entrypgdir into %cr3, why is the done like (1), instead of (2). What benefit do we get from the extra line? I tried version 2 and xv6 still runs fine it seems.(1):"movl    $(V2P_WO(entrypgdir)), %eaxmovl    %eax, %cr3"(2): "  movl    $(V2P_WO(entrypgdir)), %cr3"lab0
