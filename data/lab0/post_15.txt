Question: 
    malloc vs sbrkWhen testing both sbrk and malloc for finding the maximum memory size in xv6, is it expected that both approaches yield the same final output? If not, why does sbrk yield a higher memory limit compared to malloc? Could this discrepancy be attributed to the metadata overhead or other differences in memory management between the two methods?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Both are valid for allocating memory. However malloc will allocate more memory than is needed as it requires additional metadata to build its freelist, so take this into consideration.Regardless of whichever approach, using sbrk(0) should return the size of the processes address space (sys_sbrk in kernel/src/sysproc.c)
