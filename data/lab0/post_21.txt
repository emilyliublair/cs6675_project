Question: 
    Grading for lab0Since there is no autograder for lab 0, are we basically being graded on if our output is same/similar to those in the lab instructions and if we are using appropriate system calls?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Yep, this lab is primarily testing your understanding of system calls and writing user-space programs (which will serve as a useful tool for debugging in future labs). While your output should reasonably reflect the “correct” answer provided by the lab instructions, you’ll mainly be evaluated on if you are using the system calls correctly and your overall logic for solving the problem. That being said, we won’t be treating your submissions as pseudocode and they should run end-to-end to produce the expected results in some way or another.
