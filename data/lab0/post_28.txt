Question: 
    Debugging with GDBI have written my code for helloworld.c and am trying to run/debug it with gdb. I followed the instructions on GitHub and it just said Continuing with no change. I have tried adding additional breakpoints but it doesn't do anything. When I try to use step or next it says it cannot find bounds of current function. I am not sure where to go from here.lab0

    Student Answer: 
    Theres a note on the lab that says you might need to jump to main a couple of times because main in virtual space is at 0x0. There is going to be a couple of those because of the virtual addressing and gdb cannot differentiate it. What I did to ensure that I was at the right spot was to:- start gdb and continue until xv6 fully starts/boots- at this point your gdb terminal should just say continuing but here do CTRL-C and interrupt the gdb to set a breakpoint at main of hello world with the command from the lab instructions- then continue again in gdb- at this point we can just call the user program in the shell of xv6 that we have (the other one not gdb) and the break point should hit in gdb.Again all of this is just to avoid trial and error to find which main is your helloworld main. Hope this helps~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
