    Instructor Answer: 
    Docker is a containerization software. This just means it provides an isolated environment (container) that has the code, runtime, dependencies, and libraries for your program. To create this environment, you use a Docker image which has the application code and environment setup.For 3210, you pulled and ran an image that we provided by executing these commands in the setup guide:./scripts/docker.sh --pull# download the image from DockerHub./scripts/docker.sh# run container and mount the pwd as /xv6run code snippetVisit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets×We use Docker because:it eliminates the “it works on my machine” problem by standardizing environmentsprovides a greater level of isolation for the codeWhat we use Docker for in this course:building and compiling xv6C needs to be compiled and different compilers produce different outputs. It's important to compile in Docker because we've installed a specific version of gcc, so this process is standardizedread more about our xv6 build systemhere# these commands build xv6 and should be run in the Docker container
