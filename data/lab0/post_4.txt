Question: 
    where is initcode.S?titlelab0

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Itâ€™s in kernel/src/asm. Btw, the find command on Linux is useful for finding a file in a directory tree if you just know its name; just runfind . -name <filename>$ find . -iname initcode.S -type f./xv6/kernel/src/asm/initcode.S~ An instructor (Alexey Tumanov) endorsed this answer ~
