Question: 
    How can I find an address that is known to be unusedIn part 3 of lab 1, I understand that I need to make the e820 bios call and store the result in a memory address that is known to be unused. I am unsure how I can figure out this range of unused addresses? I know that the boot loader code begins at 0x7c00 and that addresses above 0x100000 are only accessible after being in protected mode, but I don't know where I can find more information about the way the rest of the addresses are used. I tried looking at the textbook and slides but couldn't really find anything (unless I'm looking at the wrong thing). Any advice would be appreciatedlab1

    https://wiki.osdev.org/Memory_Map_(x86)This is from the supervised lab 2 handout and gives an overview of real-mode address spaces and their use/descriptions.~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) endorsed this answer ~
