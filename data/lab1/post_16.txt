Question: 
    Confused on how to test Part 3What would it mean for it to fail? What would it mean for it to pass? I've played around with the -m flag and can't really see anything different going on when running. I've used GDB too and I get some values but I don't really know how to check whether the values are what I should be seeing or not?My code is currently failing test cases 3 and 7. Not sure why it is failing case 3 since it used to pass case 3 before starting part 3, but I assume that the issues are related.From previous Piazza threads, case 7 seems to be more physical memory than virtual, but my code seems to boot fine when I use 2GB with the -m flag. Not sure what I should be looking for.lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    One thing to be careful about: being able to boot successfully does not mean that your solution is correct. It just means that your phystop calculation routine doesnâ€™t cause a seg fault.For further verification, you can do the following:Check that your value of PHYSTOP in virtual address space is in the same ball-park as -m. So, if you set -m 2G, then your PHYSTOP value must be close to 2GUse the user-space program you wrote in Lab 0 to find the maximum amount of memory a process can allocate with your change. Does this match what you expect, based off your reading of the xv6 memory map (Figure2-2, xv6 manual)?
