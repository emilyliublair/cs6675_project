Question: 
    im getting the correct values from the call however it is not the amount of memory i put inwhen I run my program and I check the value of the phystop and the program and I am reading the e820 call correctly however the call gives me more bytes then i actually have which is strange and i don't know what to do because I cant pass the tests because of it but the value it does give me is pretty close to what it should be.lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    What command did you run xv6 with? What do your e820 records look like? It’s very unlikely that there is a bug in the e820 routine we’ve provided.

    @166_f1Anonymous Atom2 months agoI ran qemu with 256 MB  and the value I got running my program was about 267 MB and i don't know why that is. when I look into the actual values in memory after the e820 call it is indeed giving me 267 MB but that is not what i have put in and i am confused on how to fix the issue.0Elton Leander Pinto2 months agohow are you calculating MB from bytes? If you use the google calculator, it does not divide by 2^20 but by 10^6 which could be giving you an inflated resultgood comment0Anonymous Atom2 months agoi was indeed using the google calc and it was messing up the number i was getting however i am still have no idea what the problem is that makes it so i cant pass the auto grader. when i run the limits user program it gets very close to the intended value but it is still a little less (not sure if this is a problem with limits or a problem with the kernel program). when i look at the value of phystop after i run my program it is basically the exact amount of memory (a little less but i think that is intentional). im just very confused everything seems to be working good but i cant pass the autograder and i have no clue why.0Elton Leander Pinto2 months agoAre you using the upper part of the range specified in the record?good comment0Anonymous Atom2 months agowhat do you mean?0Elton Leander Pinto2 months agoThe e820 record specifies a range of addresses [phys_addr, phys_addr+len)good comment0Anonymous Atom2 months agoim using the length field for the calculation is this wrong?0Anonymous Atom2 months agofound the issue0
