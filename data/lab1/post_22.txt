Question: 
    Manually Dereferencing EBP doesn't end up at 0xF00I'm not sure what the issue is but whenever I manually go through the $ebp pointer on gdb when backtrace gets called, it always ends up going to 0. It could be something I'm doing wrong but here is a screenshot of my gdb window.Thanks in advance!lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    Have you pulled the latest changes? The lab1 branch was updated shortly before lab 1 released (last Thursday evening, IIRC), so you might not have the change which sets ebp to 0xF00 at the beginning.
