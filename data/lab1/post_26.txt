Question: 
    Why does the xv6 have the limit of 0xFE00000 as the maximum usable address?The xv6 manual says the following "Note that if a machine has more than 2 Gbyte of physical memory, xv6 can use only the memory that fits between KERNBASE and 0xFE00000". Why does the xv6 have the limit of 0xFE00000 as the maximum usable address?lab1

    Student Answer: 
    It might have to do with this: from Figure 2-2 in the textbook, all physical addresses between 0xFE000000 and 4GB are reserved for "Memory-mapped 32-bit I/O devices".~ An instructor (Pau Sum) endorsed this answer ~

    @113_f1Anonymous Helix2 months agoYep, I saw that but that figure mentions address 0xFE000000 while the caption says 0xFE00000 (order of magnitude different). Is this a typo?1Anonymous Helix2 months agoAnd if it is a typo, which address is correct?0Nathan Prashant Duggal2 months ago0xFE000000 (6 zeros) is correct~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) thinks this is a good comment ~3
