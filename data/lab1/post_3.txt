Question: 
    Part 2 works locally but fails GSHi, I am not sure if I am making some simple mistake, but I have implemented and locally tested my backtrace.c but when I submitted it I received "Test failed: didn't finish (timeout / hardfault)" even though I am pretty sure I got it working as desired. Could I please get any feedback as to the reasoning/mistake I am making?lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    I took a look at your most recent submission and it seems like you were able to get it to not timeout.
