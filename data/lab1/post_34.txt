Question: 
    What does valid return address from stab info mean?When it says that stab info cannot always find a valid return address I was a bit confused because I thought stab info gives the function address. I was wondering if this was supposed to say a valid start of function may not be found or what it meant by the valid return address may not be found?lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    Stab_info takes in an address and gives back a struct containing metadata of whatever function contains that address. Sometimes that metadata might not exist, like if a function was inlined or if the address you passed in was part of an assembly function rather than a C function. The portion of the README you cited just tells you how to handle the case when stab_info fails.
