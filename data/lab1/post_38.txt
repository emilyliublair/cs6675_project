    @87_f1Joshua Patrick Forden2 months agoHint from stab.h:const char *eip_fn_name; // Name of function containing EIP// - Note: not null terminated!2Anonymous Mouse2 months agoI mean yeah that gets you the full name with the :f(0, 3) part. Figured it out though, you need to use the length field in the struct to help truncate the string.2
