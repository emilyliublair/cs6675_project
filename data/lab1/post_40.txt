Question: 
    Running the `backtrace` function from xv6-qemu consoleThis may be a dumb question, but I'm not sure how to run `backtrace` from my xv6-qemu console for testing purposes. In Lab0 I was able to run user-space programs by just typing them into my console (like `helloworld arg1 arg2`), but this isn't working for kernel-space programs like `backtrace`. For context, I've placed my C file `backtrace.c` in the `kernel/src` directory. Getting the following error when I try to run it:$ backtraceexec: failexec backtrace failedDo I have to create a user-space program that calls `backtrace`, or is there a simpler fix that I'm overlooking? Thanks in advance.lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    Everything you can run in the shell is auserprogram. However, you added backtrace to the kernel. This means if you are to test it, you can’t simply add it toSources.cmakeand attempt to run it, because it’s part of kernel code, not user programs. So, if you want to test it then you can include the backtrace header in various spots throughout the kernel and just run the kernel. If you’d like to test it from the shell, then add a call to backtrace within some system call, creates a user program that makes a call to that syscall, and the output should populate in the console when you run the program (don’t forget to add toSources.cmake).
