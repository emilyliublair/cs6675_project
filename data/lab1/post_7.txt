Question: 
    Autograder Make FailureI finished the backtrace part of the lab and got full credit for those parts. After working on part 3 for a while and a few wrong submissions, I believe I've gotten to a point where my code seems to run properly and testing with different memory amounts seems to give me correct outputs. However, I've tried submitting twice and I've gotten a "make failure" message both times and I'm not sure why that is.lab1
