Question: 
    How to read the e820 recordsHi, if one of my e820 records started at 0x0544, how would I read it? From my understanding, the fields would be as seen below based on the gdb inspection:physical address: 0x1000000020000000length: 0x0000000000000100type: 0x1fee0000apic3: 0x00000000(gdb) x/6wx 0x05440x544: 0x00000002 0x00000001 0x00100000 0x000000000x554: 0x1fee0000 0x00000000But that doesn't seem right, since the type should be between the values of 1-5. Am I interpreting it correctly? Especially for the 8 byte fields, since I read that it should be little endian.lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    That type field looks like the lower dword of an address. I think the address of the e820 record you have is off by 4 bytes.Youâ€™re right about the type field, it will always be between 1 and 5.
