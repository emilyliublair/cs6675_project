Question: 
    CoW - Parent can still push to stack after write bit is clearedActually having no clue on what’s causing this one.In my impl,copyuvmsets the write bit to zero for both the child and parent after mapping the child’s virtual pages to the parent’s physical pages.In theory, there should be a page fault as soon as the parent process attempts to push another value to its stack. However, after returning from thatforkcall, the parent process is apparently still able to write to the page that the stack is in, and thus cause the child to return weirdly.I have checked withgdbthat in the page table, indexed by the page directory incr3, the write bit is in fact cleared the entire time. However, the dirty bit is still set seemingly after I had cleared write, and I have no idea why.Any clue on where to look next would be appreciated.lab2
