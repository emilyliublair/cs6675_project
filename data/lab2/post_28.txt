    @284_f1Anonymous Poet1 month agoWe only free pages when the number of references is 1 or at least that's what we think.0Shourik Banerjee1 month agoDo you eagerly allocate the code page?0Anonymous Poet1 month agoWould we do that in allocuvm?0Shourik Banerjee1 month agoSort of: there are a couple spots in our code where we allocuvm but it should be eagerly allocated instead of lazily allocated. You can do it in allocuvm, or you can use another method, there are a few ways to do it.1David M Nuthakki1 month agoI would suggest making 2 functions. One of them should be the original allocuvm we were given and another one that's run in the case of 0 page stuff.0
