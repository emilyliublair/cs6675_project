Question: 
    Forktest PGTRAP: err 0x4I'm getting repeated err=4 after process 7 print of forktest with my current COW implementation. Err=4 is 100 or basically the user is accessing an read only virtual address that doesn't exist. I assumed it was a TLB issue, but I can't really tell what is happening or why this is going on. Currently if I check myproc() on gdb on the error, I see that I'm actually in PID 5.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    It could be that you are updating your PTE too early or not invalidating TLB

    @245_f1Anonymous Poet1 month agoWhat exactly do you mean by too early? As for TLB, I'm invalidating it whenever a page fault occurs and there only 1 process reference to it (thus only write flag change),Â  and in copyuvm when the parent and child pte flags are changed to read.0Tanush Prathi1 month agoWhen page faulting, you should copy the page before updating the PTE, and the source should a kernel address.1
