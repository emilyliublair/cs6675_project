Question: 
    Extra PGTRAP printout on lsDoes anyone else get an additional PGTRAP printout after you implement COW and run the ls command? Normally the shell would return to just “$” but now there is a PGTRAP since the shell is a new process. It looks like this:$ PGTRAP: err: 0x7, va = 0x19a0Just want to make sure that nothing is wrong since it looks a bit weird.lab2
