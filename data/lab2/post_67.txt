Question: 
    Kalloc FailureIf kalloc fails at any point when we are allocating a page should we just kill the process everytime? Or if we are in a method should we return a fail value, like how copyuvm will return 0 on a failure.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    We shouldnâ€™t kill the process any time kalloc fails. If kalloc fails while trying to performing the page copy for CoW, then you must kill the process.
