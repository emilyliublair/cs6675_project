Question: 
    How to read cr3?I can read cr2 with rcr2 but there is no function to read cr3. I want to read cr3 to get the address of the page directory when there is a page fault. Is this necessary / should I define the function myself?lab2

    Instructor Answer: 
    You will have to define it yourself if you want to read cr3. xv6 doesn’t have a function defined for it.On whether its needed or not… think about and maybe even walk through how a virtual address gets converted to a physical address in paging. Can you extract the page directory given the faulting address (which is in cr2)?
