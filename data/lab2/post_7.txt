Question: 
    panic at the end when running ./xv6-qemuI implemented both COW and Lazy Zero and forktest match perfectly, however when I run ./xv6-qemu there seem to be a panic associate with kfree and when I use GDB and backtrace on the error it show that this is coming from deallocuvm. Is there anything that I'm missing in deallocuvm beside skipping the page that are pointed to global zero page or this is something else entirely?lab2

    Student Answer: 
    If you look in the default kfree function in kalloc.c, this panic can be caused by three conditions. Either the mod of the address and the PGSIZE being zero, or the address being out of certain bounds. Consider if your code is attempting to free memory that fits one of these descriptions. You could place a breakpoint at the beginning of kfree and inspect all the values with the "p" command in GDB.
