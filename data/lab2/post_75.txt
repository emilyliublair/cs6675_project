Question: 
    Guard PageI'm slightly confused on the virtual address of the guard page. From looking at exec and studying the initial setup, it seems like0x0000 = data0x1000 = guard0x2000 = stackHowever, after forking, it's trapping on an attempted read of a 0x1*** address. Why would anything be attempting to read from there and do I need to handle that gracefully? This should just be getting the shell up and running, so I can't imagine I need to kill a process right now.lab2

    Instructor Answer: 
    the va corresponds to a memory location in the stack itself and not in the guard page. Remember that the stack grows downwards so the 0x1000-0x2000 space would be corresponding to the stack and 0x0000 till 0x1000 to the guard page in this case
