Question: 
    odd behavior on bootup:I am getting this issue during bootup trying to implement copy on write. The weird thing is that it seems that the only thing that prints out this PGTRAP line is lab2_report_pagefault() and the only place that I call this is in my trap handler for page faulting. But after I get that initial error in bootup, my kernel kinda just spirals into this without ever hitting my break point in my trap handler. I am assuming that my bootup is going wrong because my second PGTRAP va is at 0x0 and not 0x2fcc like the expected output file. Any ideas on how to proceed and debug this?lab2

    Student Answer: 
    If you scope the x86 manual for page fault error codes, 0x0 implies it'sread on a non-presentvirtual address that caused the page fault.

    @209_f1Anonymous Beaker1 month agoI'm getting the same issue, what did you do to fix this?0Anonymous Mouse1 month agoGetting into a boot loop could be caused by multiple things. For me specifically I think I accidentally called V2P on accident (calling V2P on a physical address) and some other bugs that I found in my code. I would recommend doing a little bit of both GDB and taking a step back and think high-level about your code as well as reading through and ensuring that you don't have typos. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful ;-;1
