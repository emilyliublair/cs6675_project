Question: 
    What is meant by "undefined"In the lab readme, it says “If the owner of a thread group terminates before the other threads in the group, the behavior for those threads is undefined.”A few questions:What does undefined mean in this case?Is this similar to a parent process exiting before a child w/ fork and how the child then becomes a zombie?Should we turn the undefined thread into a zombie process?Consider the case where process 1 calls clone(), so now there is a process 2 in the ptable (the cloned thread). If clone is called on process 2, who would be the thread group owner for this process 2. Would it be P1 or P2?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    By undefined I'm pretty sure that means they just don't test for it and you don't need to worry about it.For question 4: Its thread group owner should be process 1, however its direct parent should still be process 2. This is important for recursive cloning and thread_wait.~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) endorsed this answer ~

    Instructor Answer: 
    By undefined we mean that your code is not expected to handle this case. We will not test for it.
