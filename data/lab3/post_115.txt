Question: 
    Is it possible to use your late days for lab3 extra credit early submission?Is there anyway to use your late days for the early submission, such that if you submit a day after the early submission deadline, you will use up 1 late day but will still get the extra credit for the late submission.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Late days will not be consumed. The checkpoint is a hard deadline.~ An instructor (Alexey Tumanov) endorsed this answer ~

    @392_f1Alexey Tumanov1 month agoit doesn't make sense to use your late days for the checkpoint.(1) your checkpoint is not all or nothing, i.e. your checkpoint bonus will be calculated based on the fraction of tests 1-21 you were able to complete in the latest submission before the checkpoint deadline.(2) counting late days is actually logistically complicated for the course staff, even more so when the checkpoint is NOT a separate gradescope assignment.good comment0
