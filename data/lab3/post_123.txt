    Tests 1-3 check default round robin behaviors (eg does your process yield after one time quantum)Test 9 checks if your process yields when you set a child with a higher priority than you.This is based on my own experience with the autograder, so it may not fully encompass everything that it tests for. But it should be a good place to start.
