Question: 
    Is it guaranteed that lower PID always means that a process (FIFO, high priority) is scheduled firstFor example, we had a maximum of 256 PIDS. Assume we have 256 processes running and process #5 exits. Will the next spawned process be pid == 5? In that case lower PID would not always mean the process came first.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    There are a maximum of 256 concurrent processes which is different than 256 PIDs. A pid can be any positive int.allocproc() will show how pids can chosen~ An instructor (Ved Thiru) endorsed this answer ~
