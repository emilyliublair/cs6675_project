Question: 
    Extra Credit time measurements off-by-one?If a process starts and ends within the same timeslice (i.e. before the timer interrupts), is the execution time 1 or 0? If we count it as 1 then sometimes the response time != execution + wait + io, but otherwise, having an execution time of 0 doesnâ€™t seem right.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    We are discretizing time into ticks so such rounding errors are possible. You should aim to round up, so your execution time would be 1 in that scenario. Off by one errors are inevitable by how we are measuring and discretizing time.You may also mention this in your write up, when analyzing the different algorithms.

    @590_f1Joshua Wang3 weeks agoDo we need to analyze the execution / io / wait time in the report as well? Or just the response time?0
