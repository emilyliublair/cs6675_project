Question: 
    Failing test case 35, not sure whyHi, we are only failing test case 35 and are not sure why or what to test. We've tested the normal "lost wakeup" logic (setpark->unpark->park) and also the "double setpark" problem referenced in this post:https://piazza.com/class/m5l90em6d0u656/post/406. Here's our output from setpark->setpark->unpark->park (the "double setpark" problem), which we believe is correct.We've already created user tests for the three main cases: setpark->park->unpark, unpark->setpark->park, and setpark->unpark->park (lost wakeup), and we pass all. Does anybody have insight into what the problem might be? We're getting "incorrect output" and not a hardfault, if that helps. Thanks!lab3

    @583_f1Shourik Banerjee3 weeks agoThe case referenced in the post you linked actually is setpark->unpark->setpark->park. This should result in the process not sleeping.0
