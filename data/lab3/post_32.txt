Question: 
    Confusion on Conditional VariableI believe that because a conditional variable depends on a condition, its struct should have an element that tracks this condition; however, I am not sure how the autograder would use this field. In my implementation, after cond_init, a user would be able to set the condition in the conditional variable to true or false, which would affect the behavior of cond_wait. I just donâ€™t know if the autograder will interact with this in the way I expect.lab3

    @555_f1Anonymous Beaker5 days agoThe autograder is very loose in its conditional checks so you should write some good local tests. I suspect the autograder is really only checking the return values.0
