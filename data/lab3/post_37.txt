Question: 
    Lab3 extra credit exit time populationFor the extra credit assignment, we're supposed to create a sys_call that populates a struct with information about that process. One of the metrics is exit_time. How can we populate exit_time information for a process that hasn't exited yet?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Both the exit_time and response_time metrics can only be populated once the process has exited. So feel free the appropriate function that deals with this and update both the metrics there
