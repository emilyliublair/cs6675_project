    @543_f1Killian Patrick Vetter6 days agoI return 0 but I'm still failing test case 38 so let me know if that lets you pass0Anonymous Mouse6 days agoTest case 38 is intended to pass (return 0). There is likely an issue with cond itself or park, setpark, unpark or mutex. My partner and I had issues with 38 even after we passed all other test cases.0
