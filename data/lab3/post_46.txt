Question: 
    Weird bug where Test Case 7 occasionally doesn't pass the autograderI was wondering if there is any particular behavior that causes this inconsistency. I'm pretty sure the scheduler implementation is correct because it passes 7 about 9/10 times we submit on gradescope. I was wondering if it was a potential locking issue, but as far as I know we didn't need to use our own locks for scheduler (only ptable which I'm pretty sure is correct).lab3

    @534_f1Shourik Banerjee5 days agoPotentially resolved? I used ticks to determine ready time but re-reading the lab spec it appears that ticks tracks the number of time quantums that have passed.So this means that if two FIFO processes are added one after another but in the same time quantum, there is a chance that the incorrect one would get picked since they have the same ticks but their actually ready times should be different.0
