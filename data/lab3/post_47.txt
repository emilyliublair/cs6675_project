Question: 
    Lab 3 Part 3 Threads Test Case 24 (and 31)I'm currently passing all test cases for Clone + Threads except for the Threads test case 24 (and also 31). I'm not exactly sure what's wrong since I walked through my thread_create and thread_wait with a TA who confirmed that my implementation was correct. During my test as well, I couldn't find anything that seemed to be wrong either. Are there any tips or hints as to what it's testing beyond just the "general testing" description or what might mess it up?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    Test 31 deals with locking shared resources. Check out a couple other threads on the topic by just searching 31. As for 24, I don't really know anything. My partner and I passed 24 before we even implemented part 3 which implies to me that it is a return -1 case. Not sure if thats the issue, but its worth a shot!
