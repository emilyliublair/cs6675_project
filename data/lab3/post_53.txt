    @516_f1Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoHi, I’ve ran a few user space tests where I set up a clone and then have an if statement for return value 0, but the if statement never seems to execute.Do I need to change the context of the new process at all, right now it still goes to forkret0Anonymous Atom3 weeks agoDid you end up fixing this? I also pass all of clone except case 12 and my clone doesn't return 0 in the child for some reason. I clear eax after copying the trap frame0Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoNope, I’m still struggling with this, going tot rt to go to office hours either today or tomorrow but have a pretty packed schedule.0Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoHey I think I figured it out, check your syscall.c file for any places where you might be using bad/0 values if you recently cloned something.0
