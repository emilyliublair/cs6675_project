    @514_f1Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoThat's what I thought. Just wanted to be sure.0@514_f2Anonymous Helix3 weeks agoI don’t think the student response is true. Look at argc/argv parameters pushed onto the stack in exec; they should be deeper into the stack than the return address (0xffff…) and should be preserved in the cloned thread.0Pau Sum3 weeks agoYes above the return address for main, there are arguments for main. You do not have to worry about copying these though. Check figure 2-3 in the xv6 manual for more details.good comment2
