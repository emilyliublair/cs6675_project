Question: 
    malloc throwing a page faultCurrently testing the threading library. The test program I wrote attempts to create 128 child threads and then waits for each one of them at the end. My approach to creating threads is tomalloca fixed amount of memory at a time for the child stack.The bug is that at seemingly random points in the process of creating threads,mallocgenerates a page fault with error code0x7:pid 3 tth: trap 14 err 7 on cpu 0 eip 0x671 addr 0x87240ff3--kill procThe instruction that generated the fault is81    p->s.size = nunits;I don’t exactly understand how malloc works tbh, so I’m at a loss on where to start. Any hints/suggestions would be welcomed.P.S. Would it make sense to usesbrkinstead ofmallocin this one? I’ve usedmallocin all past labs, which was why it was my go-to here.lab3

    Student Answer: 
    We got the same error, it had to do with stack overflow in the clone stack, which overwrote the heap block metadata, such as size and ptr. If it overwrites size, then the calculated ptr can inadvertently point to kernel space and kill the process.
