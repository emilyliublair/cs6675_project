Question: 
    Make Failure On SubmissionCurrently when submitting, I get a make error despite being able to build locally in both release and debug mode and implementing (what I believe) to be necessary for the system call stubs. I wrote a userspace program to test the stubs for setscheduler, clone, waitpid, park, setpark, unpark, and waitinfo and I am able to call each system call from the userspace program. I am lost as to what else could cause the autograder to fail during make. Is there something that I am missing?lab3

    @488_f1Anonymous Atom3 weeks agoSame here, tried everything I can think of but all it does is burn through my submissions.0Anonymous Comp3 weeks agoI ended up fixing the issue by just continuing to work on the lab and implementing setpark/park/unpark. I had the stubs set up before to return -1 so maybe that was causing my issue? I'm sorry I don't know what really fixed it.0
