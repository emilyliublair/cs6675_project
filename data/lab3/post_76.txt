Question: 
    Part 1 EC: IO Time MeasurementIs it valid to measure IO time by the amount of time the process slept?Also, should I subtract IO time from wait time so that this holds true? I'm currently measuring wait time as time_not_spent_on_processor - time_spent_sleeping, with IO being time_spent_sleeping.response = IO+execution+waitlab3
