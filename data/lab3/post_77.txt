Question: 
    Only failing AG Test 14 for cloneWe are passing all of the test cases for clone() besides 14. I've been testing a large batch of clones writing to a variable defined by a parent and getting page faults only when the parent tries to access that value after it's been written by a clone. I'm not sure if it is a race condition as it always occurs after the same clone writes to that var regardless of the core count passed to qemu (edit: it's def a race condition). I think that this is related to failing test 14 but I'm not totally sure. Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated!lab3

    Student Answer: 
    When my partner and I were failing 14 its because we had an small error related to our stack. Our size was off by 3 bytes (because of a casting issue) and that caused us to be unable to read the return address on the childs stack. Not sure if this is your issue, but its what we encountered. Hope that helps!
