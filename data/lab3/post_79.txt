Question: 
    What happens if the address stack* for clone is allocated but not writable?lets say that stack* is a VA that has been allocated to the process. However, this VA could be a guard page which is unwritable (it could also be where the binary is located, or just non-empty chunks of memory in general).Should clone return -1 in these cases or should we allow the process to get killed by a fault handler?lab3

    Answered in@440Edit: some more context – the user is allowed to make mistakeswith its own memory, so if the user program wants to mess itself up by passing in the guard page, then so be it. However, clone should gracefully handle the cases when the user may be trying to mess with memory that doesn’t belong to it.
