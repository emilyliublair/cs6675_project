Question: 
    Part 4 Spinlock keeping track of lock ownerDo we need to keep track of the process/thread that is holding a lock (especially to make sure that you're calling release only if you hold the lock)? If so, any tips to keep track of who is holding the lock since pid is not accessible from user space?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    You can use the getpid() syscall to get the PID of the current process in user space.~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
