Question: 
    Child write() calls wont show up on screen.I have clone working so that the new stack is correctly setup and in userspace you can distinguish between the child and parent thread (via the return value).If I do a printf in userspace in the parent thread, it prints correctly. If i do this for the child thread, it makes the correct write() system calls but none of the characters show up on the screen.lab3
