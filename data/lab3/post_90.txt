Question: 
    Test Case 5Does anyone know what test case 5 tests for? I pass every other scheduling test except for this. I've written user space tests that test for FIFO/Round ordering, priority ordering for FIFO, priority ordering for Round Robin with preemption and maintaining a queue, immediate preemption following setscheduler, and multicore scheduling.lab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    I see that you've passed the test now. Nice!

    @451_f1Anonymous Atom1 month agoIt has something to do with the fact that a process or its parent modifies priority such that it should become the new process to run. Make sure you preempt when a new process becomes the best one.0Erel Ozen1 month agoI thought this was test case 9?0Rohan Bansal1 month agoI think:Test case 9 checks whether the current process has had its priority decreased (and if a better process should preempt it).Test case 5 checks whether the modified process's priority is now greater than the current process (and so preempt the current process).~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) thinks this is a good comment ~1
