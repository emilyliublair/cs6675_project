    @692_f1Anonymous Scale7 days agoI calculated a reasonable FSSIZE (~20000) and tried re-ran the autograder, but it didn’t work. Can’t really waste autograder submissions now so I’ll have to come back to this later. Ty tho!0Erel Ozen6 days agoTry a higher FSSIZE, 20000, only allows for one 8 MB file.0
