    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    It’s talking about all the files that are created when xv6 is built. If you examine user/Sources.cmake you’ll see a command that runs tools/mkfs to prepopulate the user disk image with a collection of files (normally all the user programs and README, as well as the root directory itself). These should default to being readable and writable for all users.
