    Instructor Answer: 
    Access checks should only occur when you open the file. If you have a file open and the inode permissions or your permissions change, your access to the file should not be changed. (This is a feature; it allows you to selectively allow access to files by opening the files and then setuidâ€™ing, and is how all processes are able to read to and write from /console even though its perms are 0.)
