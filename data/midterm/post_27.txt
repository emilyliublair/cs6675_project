Question: 
    

    Student Answer: 
    I imagine in this method you'd also have to find some way to store the encryption method you used in order to encrypt the password, and the question becomes how do you accurately encrypt this data. Or, you could just use every single one from some list of encryption algorithms, but this would add overhead to your system and the hackers could get access to this information as well. Also, I imagine people have prepped rainbow tables for many different encryption algorithms, adding a lot of overhead to your system but minimal overhead to the hacker's.

    @705_f1Anonymous Calc4 days agoWell you have to store the salts somewhere as well. A lot of encryption algorithms use a key for encryption, so the different encryption would be done via providing a different key.0Ashwin Amitabh Mudaliar4 days agoThe salts are stored but they are of little use - you've already storedhash(salt+password), and it is very unlikely that a rainbow table entry exists for this salt + password combination. On your implementation, forgive me if I'm incorrect, but you'd have to store the key as well right?0
