    Instructor Answer: 
    Static (i.e. non-interactive),offlinecontent is allowed on your laptop. With that said, in cases where it may be hard to distinguish whether your word document is online or offline, it's best if you generate a PDF and use PDFs instead. Otherwise, this may attract a proctor's attention. No use of internet other than to access your canvas quiz is allowed.
