Question: 
    

    Student Answer: 
    Yeah that is it I believe. In an 8 bit system, if you are addressing a low level address like 00000001, then your index into the page directory and the page table are most likely going to be all zeros. But if you are addressing a high address, like the stack, then your indexes into these structures will be different, and therefore will need to point to a different page table and a different physical page.

    Instructor Answer: 
    yes, we don't just coalesce PTEs by packing them into as few PTPs as possible. Every single PTE corresponds to a specific Virtual Frame Number (VFN). If your application is using virtual memory sparsely sprinkled throughout your virtual address space, it could happen that it will sparsely use PTEs sprinkled across many PTPs at the last level.
