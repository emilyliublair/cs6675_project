    Instructor Answer: 
    The student answer is right, the shell always executes files in the current directory.I don’t know exactly why ls didn’t work the first time, but a common issue happens when you mistype a command, press backspace, and then try to correct it; xv6’s sh doesn’t handle backspaces correctly, treating them as just the ASCII character 0x08/^H instead of properly removing the last character from the input line. The terminal window correctly interprets the backspace character, though, so what you see as “ls” might actually have been, say, “ld^Hs” internally
