Question: 
    finding memory from e820 callFor part 3 of lab 1, I have tried to call do_e820 in bootasm.s with a destination address specified. However I when I check if there is data at that address using xp in the qemu monitor and x in gdb (but maybe this is just for virtual addresses?) once a breakpoint at the beginning of main hits, everything seems to be set to 0 no matter what I do.Will the result of the e820 bios call be at the exact destination address specified? Or am I looking for it too late in the kernel startup? What is a good strategy for testing/debugging?lab1

    @102_f1Rohan Natansh Bafna3 months agoCould you send a few screenshots of your gdb session, C code, and the disassembly (the relevant portion of /xv6/build/kernel/kernel.asm) in a private post? It's kind of hard to figure out what might have happened just from that description.good comment0Anonymous Beaker3 months agoThis same thing is happening to me except I also commented out all my code and restarted the docker container, its still looping through the "Booting from Hard Disk.." screen, any ideas on how to fix?1Anonymous Helix3 months agoYou might have a bad state because of the bootloop. I think you should do make clean or fully delete your build directory and re-make the project.0Anonymous Comp3 months agoI found doing all of the above, plus rebuilding the container helped.0
