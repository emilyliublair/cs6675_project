Question: 
    Part 3: Odd behavior with kernel ram functionI have written corresponding code in the kernel in-order to find the records written from code that I have written in bootasm.S. Looking at it high level it seems fine but caused xv6 to be stuck in a boot-loop. I used GDB to inspect what was happening in my kernel code and I am having a hard time trying to figure out what is happening. For example, when I first get into my function i set some unsigned int to zero. But when I use GDB and run "info locals" or "p <variable_name>" its giving me "variable_name = 65684". This happens to a couple of other variables that I initialize in the beginning of the function. Any thoughts?lab1
