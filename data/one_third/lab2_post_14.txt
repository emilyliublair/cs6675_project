Question: 
    Implementation Boots/Works with Debug flag but not with Release flagHi, when we make with the Debug flag, everything works perfectly. Usertests as well as forktest, and our own custom tests. However, when we make with the release flag, xv6-qemu doesn't boot. I also tried making with the -o3 flag and this also works perfectly. I don't really know where to go from here - is there anyway we could see what release is doing differently from -o3 flag?lab2
