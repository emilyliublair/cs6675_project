Question: 
    What priority and scheduler should newly created threads have?I originally had the default implementation of scheduler and I ended up being able to pass thread cases 27 to 30. However, after implementing the priority FIFO and Round Robin schedulers, the Thread Library now seems to fail 27 to 30 (it also fails 23 now). What might be the cause of this? Should thread priority and scheduler be set to 0 and Round Robin by default?I've attached locks to every shared variable write+read that I can find.lab3

    @509_f1Anonymous Poet3 weeks agoWhy would creating a new state not work? Is it because unpark should wake any sleeping process on a channel, regardless of if it was put to sleep by park or not? I think in that case, you could just check in unpark if the process on that channel is either asleep or in the new state to wake it up and it would be valid.0
