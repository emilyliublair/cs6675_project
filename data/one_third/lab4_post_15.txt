Question: 
    XV6 hangs on bootup after implementing part 4I implemented part 4 and also edited mfks, and now xv6 gets stuck when loading, it just prints these lines:Booting from Hard Disk..xv6...cpu0: starting 0sb: size 32768 nblocks 32701 ninodes 200 nlog 30 logstart 2 inodestart 32 bmap start 58In GDB, these functions keep getting called:#1  0x80105fcc in pushcli () at /xv6/kernel/src/spinlock.c:108#2  0x80105140 in myproc () at /xv6/kernel/src/proc.c:61#3  0x8010633f in fetchint (addr=11172, ip=0x8dfbcec0) at /xv6/kernel/src/syscall.c:20#4  0x80107346 in sys_exec () at /xv6/kernel/src/sysfile.c:471#5  0x801064e3 in syscall () at /xv6/kernel/src/syscall.c:153#6  0x80107ad4 in trap (tf=0x8dfbcfb4) at /xv6/kernel/src/trap.c:43#7  0x8010005e in alltraps () at /xv6/kernel/src/asm/trapasm.S:20#8  0x8dfbcfb4 in ?? ()Did anyone else run into something similar? I have not changed itrunc if that matters (I assumed system would still boot without it).lab4
