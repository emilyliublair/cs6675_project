Question: 
    Failing Test 11I've checked all of my file creating logic and checked for owner and perms everywhere I can think of. Are there any hints for what this case could be testing that I may have missed?lab4

    Student Answer: 
    either work you just need to make sure that read and write permissions are set if you choose to create the files while building the file system or in init_hook. i tried both and ended up in init_hook for my current implementation because it was easier to set file permissions.~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
