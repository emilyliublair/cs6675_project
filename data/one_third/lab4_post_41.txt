Question: 
    how to append to filesI'm storing my user login information in a file for part 3. Does anyone know how to append text to the last written thing in the file? It seems like my writes are overwriting each other.lab4

    Student Answer: 
    What I've done is basically read until you can't anymore, then write.~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~

    Instructor Answer: 
    I think checking the password to make sure it doesn't contain ':' and a '\n' character should be good enough

Make sure to check for not having newline '\n' characters regardless in both the casesgood comment0
