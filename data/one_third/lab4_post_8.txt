    @696_f1Anonymous Helix7 days agoI did this, and now I can make correctly locally with many large files, however, the autograder still gives me a make error. Does anyone know if the make error is due to make actually failing, or if the output of make doesn't match the expected outcome (due to prints or something).1Cagin Uz7 days agoTest case 32 has to do with iappend. You need account for double indirectness in iappend (the structure is pretty similar to how it already does singly indirect).0
