Question: 
    Looking for PartnerHey, I’ve not found anyone to work with for projects yet. I’m a 3rd year sysarch/info student, and I’ll be available to work on projects mostly in the mornings and late afternoons/nights. My schedule isn’t too bad (other classes are processor design, compilers, vip, and spanish), but I’m also a TA and a club officer, so I may occasionally be a lot busier. If anyone’s interested, email me at rjones402@gatech.edu and share your schedule so we can see if we can make it work. Thanks!logistics
