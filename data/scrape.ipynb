      "VSCode xv6 Development and Debugging SetupI’ve developed a VSCode development environment config that I believe will provide a lot of value to people working on the labs. It makes xv6 easier to develop with compared to the previous process of manually building the project, launching the Docker container, using gdb to debug from the command line, running submission script, etc. I provide some launch and task scripts to automatically launch a VSCode server from within the docker container automatically as well as enable easy building of the project and launching of a debugging environment which seamlessly integrates with VSCode’s GUI debugger. This allows one to do cool things like:Step through the code and set breakpoints from within VSCode GUIEasily inspect the call stack, local variables, memory, CPU state, disassembler output, etc.Have easy debugger controls, like step-into, step-out-of, continue, pause, etc.and much more!Config Setup:Downloadconfig.zipand extract its contents into the top level directory of your repo. This will put the custom.devcontainerand.vscodefolders there.Install theDev ContainersVSCode extension.Open the xv6 project in VSCode if you have not done so yet. Press Shift+Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux) or Shift+Cmd+P (MacOS) to open the command palette and type “Dev Containers: Reopen in Container” and press enter to make sure that the project opens in the Docker container.If you see a dialogue upon entering the project that says something about picking build tools, just select the GCC option (should be the last option in the list).Config Usage:Debugging: To debug the project, you just press F5 (fn+F5 if on MacOS) which builds and starts an interactive debugging session. You’ll be able to interact with the running xv6 in the terminal tab at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, a small debugging panel will appear that has several important debugging controls on it (experiment with them or hover over them to see their purpose). If you want to set a breakpoint first before debugging (you can set them while debugging too), just use your mouse to create a breakpoint by clicking on the area to the left of the line numbers in a file in VSCode (you should see a small red circle there as a breakpoint). The breakpoint can be toggled by pressing it again.Building and Running Only: If you just want to build and run the project, you can open the command palette, type “Tasks: Run Task”, select this and then select the “start-xv6” task.Submission: To quickly build and run the submission script, you can select the “submit” task which will build the project and create the submission.zip file.Notes:When you launch VSCode again and if the project was the last worked-on project, VSCode will automatically open it in the Docker container. If it wasn’t the last project, you can easily reopen it by going into File > Open Recent and selecting the option with “/xv6 [Dev Container]” in it.For those that want to edit which module is being debugged (kernel is the default), you can do this by editing the.vscode/launch.jsonconfig:{\"configurations\": [\n",
      "        {\"name\":\"(gdb) Attach\",\"type\":\"cppdbg\",\"request\":\"launch\",\"program\":\"${workspaceFolder}/build/kernel/kernel\",//change this to themoduletodebug,e.g. ${workspaceFolder}/build/user/_limits...run code snippetVisit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets×I’ll be working on having a better method of setting the module dynamically in the future, which would be activated when pressing the Debug button in the top right of the editor window while viewing an arbitrary file in the project.Caveats:I’ve only tested my scripts on MacOS, so your mileage may vary on Windows or Linux. Let me or others know if modifications are required for the config to work on Windows or Linux.It seems like Dev Containers and WSL has some incomptability, as referenced by these Github issues:#9357,#10338,#9296, and#9064. A potential temporary fix may be to downgrade the Dev Containers version to v0.309.0 (reference).lab0lab1lab2lab3lab4\n",

      "[Lab0]: Part3 - limits.cHello! I am working on lab0 part 3 where we are trying to find the maximum number of memory that we have for page allocation. I was following the implementation detailed in the lab instructions and after waiting a bit i got my printout to print to the shell. But, I also got a printout of \"allocuvm out of memory\" is this the intended printout or am I doing something wrong?Screenshot_2025-01-13_at_3.47.43_PM.pnglab0\n",

I have tried adding additional breakpoints but it doesn't do anything. When I try to use step or next it says it cannot find bounds of current function. I am not sure where to go from here.lab0\n",
      "Theres a note on the lab that says you might need to jump to main a couple of times because main in virtual space is at 0x0. There is going to be a couple of those because of the virtual addressing and gdb cannot differentiate it. What I did to ensure that I was at the right spot was to:- start gdb and continue until xv6 fully starts/boots- at this point your gdb terminal should just say continuing but here do CTRL-C and interrupt the gdb to set a breakpoint at main of hello world with the command from the lab instructions- then continue again in gdb- at this point we can just call the user program in the shell of xv6 that we have (the other one not gdb) and the break point should hit in gdb.Again all of this is just to avoid trial and error to find which main is your helloworld main.

      "\"zombie!\" on forkexecI am getting \"zombie!\" printed in terminal when testing forkexec.c. Is this because my parent process is not waiting for the child to finish? Is it expected that the parent always waits?lab0\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you are right, and it is expected that the parent waits ... kind of. The reason that parents normally wait for their children is that when a process dies, the kernel context associated with that process needs to be cleaned up, but a kernel context can't clean up itself. So, the process is left in memory as a \"zombie\" process, and is only fully removed when its parent waits on the child, since then the kernel is in another process's context and can safely clean up the dead child process (how morbid!)If a parent dies before its children do, then the children are adopted by init,which is what prints the zombie! linein xv6. Normally in Unix systems, this is actually done quite regularly, to create daemons (long running system services); fork, the parent dies, and the child becomes a direct child of init. (Actually, this is normally done twice due to how processes interact with terminals, google \"double forking\" if you're interested.) There's nothing explicitlywrongwith a parent dying before its children, but if you're not creating a daemon process it's better to let the parent clean up the child itself.\n",

      "xv6 Setup: Common Issues + SolutionsHey everyone,With lab 0 now released, we thought it would be helpful to send out a list of common issues + fixes for various xv6 setup issues that you all may have encountered on Wednesday.Rosetta Issues on MacWe’ve update the xv6 Docker image, so simply re-cloning the repo should fix any Rosetta-related issues. However, if you still see Rosetta-related errors when trying to start xv6, then do the following:Open Docker desktopNavigate to Docker Settings > GeneralUncheck the “Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon” optionWindows Setup IssuesThere are two common issues that we observed on Windows systems.Window auto-converting to CRLF line endings, which interfere with the ability to execute xv6’s setup scripts. We have already updated the.gitattributeson the repo, which means if you re-clone the repo this issue should be resolved. However, if this doesn’t work, then you can manually create a.gitattributesfile in the root of your repo and simply add\\* text=auto eol=lf. You can also disable this behavior globally by runninggit config --global core.autocrlf falsebefore you clone the repo.It is imperative that you use WSL with Ubuntu for running the setup scripts/docker container, as alternatives (such as Git Bash) have proven to be unreliable.These should cover most of the common setup problems across both OSes.
