Question: 
    Extra credit (max # of processes): OK to comment out code and print final result?For the final extra credit question, if I comment out the part 4 code (maximum possible allocated memory) I get the right answer for max # of processes, however if I leave it in, I get a much smaller answer, which I think occurs due to all the allocated memory. Thus to leave in both code segments I would need to use malloc() and keep an array of pointers to later call free() on in the part 4 code to free up the allocated memory. However, the size of that array would have to be hardcoded, which requires me to know the maximum possible size of allocated memory in the first place.I don't want to comment out the part 4 code since I don't want to prioritize extra credit over it, so is it fine if I comment out the extra credit code and have it print out the answer you would get if you run it in isolation (with part 4 code commented out)? I can explain my reasoning via commentslab0

    Instructor Answer: 
    That script just makes a zip file of all the source code. For autograded labs, your code will be compiled in release mode when you submit it to Gradescope, but lab 0 will be handgraded. You should make sure that your programs behave properly under both configurations to double check that there is no undefined behavior.
