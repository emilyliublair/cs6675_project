Question: 
    Extracredit Out of inodesWhen running my program for extra credit to calculate the maximum number of files in a directory I'm hitting the limit of inodes set in the operating system and am not able to stress the number of files that can be in a directory. Should I increase the maximum number of inodes or is this the limit I should be hitting?lab0
