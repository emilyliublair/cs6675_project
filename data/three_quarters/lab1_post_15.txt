Could you show the commands you type?good comment1Anonymous Comp3 months agohere it is:(gdb) file /xv6/kernel/src/main.cA program is being debugged already.Are you sure you want to change the file? (y or n) y"/xv6/kernel/src/main.c": not in executable format: file format not recognized(gdb)0Alexa Suzanne Fazio3 months agoYou don't need to use the file command when debugging the kernel. GDB will already have the kernel symbols loaded when you start the session. file command is only for debugging user space programs.After you run gdb just set a breakpoint and continue.good comment0Anonymous Comp3 months agoahhh I see that's my bad. Thanks for your help!0
