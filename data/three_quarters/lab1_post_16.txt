    Instructor Answer: 
    One thing to be careful about: being able to boot successfully does not mean that your solution is correct. It just means that your phystop calculation routine doesnâ€™t cause a seg fault.For further verification, you can do the following:Check that your value of PHYSTOP in virtual address space is in the same ball-park as -m. So, if you set -m 2G, then your PHYSTOP value must be close to 2GUse the user-space program you wrote in Lab 0 to find the maximum amount of memory a process can allocate with your change. Does this match what you expect, based off your reading of the xv6 memory map (Figure2-2, xv6 manual)?
