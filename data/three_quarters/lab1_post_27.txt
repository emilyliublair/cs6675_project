Question: 
    Why does the xv6 have the limit of 0xFE00000 as the maximum usable address?The xv6 manual says the following "Note that if a machine has more than 2 Gbyte of physical memory, xv6 can use only the memory that fits between KERNBASE and 0xFE00000". Why does the xv6 have the limit of 0xFE00000 as the maximum usable address?lab1

    Student Answer: 
    It might have to do with this: from Figure 2-2 in the textbook, all physical addresses between 0xFE000000 and 4GB are reserved for "Memory-mapped 32-bit I/O devices".~ An instructor (Pau Sum) endorsed this answer ~

    Instructor Answer: 
    The e820 records that you get in xv6 are provided by qemu's BIOS; they don't have to be (and probably aren't) the same as whatever example you found on Wikipedia.
