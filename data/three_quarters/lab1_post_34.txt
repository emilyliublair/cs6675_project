    Instructor Answer: 
    Stab_info takes in an address and gives back a struct containing metadata of whatever function contains that address. Sometimes that metadata might not exist, like if a function was inlined or if the address you passed in was part of an assembly function rather than a C function. The portion of the README you cited just tells you how to handle the case when stab_info fails.
