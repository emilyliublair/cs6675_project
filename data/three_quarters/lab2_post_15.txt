Question: 
    Failing Test cases 9 and 10Hi there, so I'm failing test cases 9 and 10. I'm a little confused because I was passing these earlier back when I had just part 1 finished but after adding zero paging I don't know why it's failing now. I was at office hours all day today but due to the amount of other people here I wasn't able to get any guidance. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!lab2

Not sure about 10.0Anonymous Helix2 months agowould I panic or just exit the process in this case?0Shourik Banerjee2 months agoKill the process0Anonymous Helix2 months agoWithin the trap.c file I am checking to see whenever I do kalloc if it returns 0. If it does I kill the process and then I break. Is this enough?
