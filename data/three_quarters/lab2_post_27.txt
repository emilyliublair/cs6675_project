Question: 
    Trap triggered at end of testsHey guys,I am implementing 0 pagiging right now and I need some help debugging. The fork test runs all almost all of the way through but fails at the end due to the initial process exiting. It is being killed cause the pte is 0 (invalid) for the faulting address. I think the problem is in dealloc, as another post had a similar issue and solved it by not freeing the 0 page, but I have been checking and I can't seem to figure out why our 0 page is getting freed. I have checks in freevm, dealloc, and kfree to check if the 0 page is getting freed and I am still encountering this error (COW is passing tests).Does anyone know if this might not be a problem with freeing the 0 page? Lmk if yall had a similar issue. Thanks!Picture:here is what happens when just booting the oslab2
