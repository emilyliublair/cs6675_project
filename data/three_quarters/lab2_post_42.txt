It doesn't load up for some reasongood comment0Anonymous Scale2 months agoJust did, sorry for the inconvenience0Sukrit Kumar2 months agoFor some reason piazza is still glitching on my end, if possible can you reply with the image here ?good comment0Anonymous Scale2 months agoDoes this fix it?0Sukrit Kumar2 months agoYes it did, so from the looks of it output $1 printed above is the sz of the data+text of the init program that and $2 is the output value after the roundup happens hence 4096 (0x1000).The initial stack pointer location for a program will depend on the size of the program and hence the text+data segment.init layout:0x0000 - 0x1000: Program (text + data) (4096)0x1000 - 0x2000: Guard page (4096+PGSIZE)0x2000 - 0x3000: Stack (4096+PGSIZE, 4096+2*PGSIZE)sp points to 0x3000 after setupSo in the case of sh the layout will look like this:0x0000 - 0x2000: Program (text + data) (8192)0x2000 - 0x3000: Guard page (8192+PGSIZE)0x3000 - 0x4000: Stack (8192+PGSIZE, 8192+2*PGSIZE)sp points to 0x4000 for shThe sp basically represent the top of each process's virtual address space after all allocations and each process has it's own distinct virtual address layout hence the diff sp values. Hope this makes sense.Also the page zero's are expected for 0x0, 0x1000, and 0x3000 after the first timegood comment2
