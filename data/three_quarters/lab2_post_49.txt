Question: 
    general protection fault (trap 13 err 0)I am getting a general protection error near the end of running both forktest-xv6-qemu and xv6-qemu. It happens after a page trap and the instruction generating this exception is anininstruction.forktest-xv6-qemu general protection fault instruction:forktest-xv6-qemu error output (after trap):xv6-qemu general protection fault instruction and trap frame:xv6-qemu error output (after page copy):xv6-qemu trapframe of page trap before trap 13, CPL=3:Fromthisit seems that one possibility is that the error is caused by CPL>IOPL during the execution ofin. But it seems that CPL is supposed to be 3. When running forktest-xv6-qemu, the output I get is missing one pgzero call before the line “3: I am ‘’”, so there’s definitely something wrong, but I’m not sure how to go about debugging this.lab2
