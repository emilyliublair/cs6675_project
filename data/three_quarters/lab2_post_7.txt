Question: 
    Gradescope SubmissionI basically didn't change anything in my code other than deleting some print statements that I thought were maybe causing issues with the autograder. However, when I deleted them and submitted my code, I got zero test cases correct even though I passed more than half of them previously and even timed out on some of them even though I didn't time out before. I had no idea what I changed, so I tried downloading the old version of my code from gradescope and resubmit it just to see if that would fix it but now I have zero test cases correct with some even timing out. However, my forktest output matches that of the forktest-complete.out completely and usertests all pass. Are there any ideas what may be causing this issue?lab2
