Question: 
    Long time to run autograderI realize there's quite a few test cases, but how long is it supposed to take the autograder to run? It's been running for over half an hour and hasn't timed out yet. Thanks!lab3

    Student Answer: 
    I found that sometimes it took over 30 minutes. Annoying, but I think it'll get better as we implement more of the lab. The reason for the timeouts is that we haven't implemented many parts and they all time out.~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) endorsed this answer ~
