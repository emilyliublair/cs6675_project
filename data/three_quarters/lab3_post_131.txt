Question: 
    Round Robin Scheduler ClarificationConsider the following buffer under a priority round robin scheduler:1 | 3 | 4 | 3Our pointer is currently at 1, and 1 has just completed. We then select 4 as our next process. 4 yields, and we then select the 2nd 3 4 awakens, and takes the cpu 4 yields againIn this scenario, should we next run the 1st 3 or the 2nd 3?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    It doesn't matter. The autograder does not test which process goes first if they are the same priority; as long as no processes starve, you should be fine.I had a round robin implementation that did not go by scheduler order (but instead by arrival time), and I was told this was fine by the TAs due to the reason above.

    Instructor Answer: 
    Higher priority processes always take priority over lower priority processes, even if they were just scheduled.

    @362_f1Anonymous Atom1 month agoSo in that case do we literally just let Round Robin only give the highest priority process CPU time?0Ved Thiru1 month agoYes; any other solution and you would effectively be providing the high-priority process with the same priority as a lower-priority process.good comment0Anonymous Atom1 month agoOk great, def got confused at office hours earlier this week then!0
