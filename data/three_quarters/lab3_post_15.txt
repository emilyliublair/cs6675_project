    Late Days for Part 1 Extra CreditIs it okay to use the late days for the part 1 extra credit?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    We are discretizing time into ticks so such rounding errors are possible. You should aim to round up, so your execution time would be 1 in that scenario. Off by one errors are inevitable by how we are measuring and discretizing time.You may also mention this in your write up, when analyzing the different algorithms.
