Question: 
    Can waitpid only wait on child?In the Part 2 description, it’s clear that the intended use forwaitpidis for a parent to be able to wait on a specific child thread. However, it wasn’t explicitly stated whether this is the only situation wherewaitpidshould allow itself to be used. Can any process wait on any process usingwaitpid, or shouldwaitpidonly permit A to wait on B if A is B’s parent?Thankslab3

    @543_f1Killian Patrick Vetter3 weeks agoI return 0 but I'm still failing test case 38 so let me know if that lets you pass0Anonymous Mouse3 weeks agoTest case 38 is intended to pass (return 0). There is likely an issue with cond itself or park, setpark, unpark or mutex. My partner and I had issues with 38 even after we passed all other test cases.0
