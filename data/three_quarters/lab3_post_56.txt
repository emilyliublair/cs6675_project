Question: 
    Mismatch between setpark and park chansConsider the case:setpark(CHANNEL 1);unpark(CHANNEL 1);// at this point, you should be in some type of lost wake up statepark(CHANNEL 2);now, the park is for a different channel. should you go to sleep, or ignore the park even though it is for a different channel?There are dozens of other permutations of this problem as well:setpark(CHANNEL 1);unpark(CHANNEL 1);setpark(CHANNEL 2);Should the second setpark remember the unpark, even if it was a different channel?Questions:1) Will the test cases (specifically 35) check for these changing channels?2) If so, the instructions do not mention how to handle these cases.lab3
