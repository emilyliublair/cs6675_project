Question: 
    Edge cases for Clone to testI was wondering if anyone knew of any good edge cases to test for clone? I am currently not passing cases 11-13 and 15-17 and not really sure what to test (all hardfaults).I have tested created a bunch of clones, writing to a global variable in a cloned thread and checking it in the parent, opening and closing file descriptors in the child and parent and checking if the changes have taken place, changing the current working directory and checking in the parent, and changing the size of a process in the child and checking if that has applied to the parent.I suspect it has something to do with stack copying or exiting but I am not really sure how to write a usertest for those. Any tips would be appreciated!lab3
