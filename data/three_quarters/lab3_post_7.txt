Question: 
    Waitinfo fails test 7After implementing waitinfo, I now fail test 7 (pass all other test). My locking order is ptable.lock then tickslock (consistently, to avoid deadlocking). I saw@534has the same issue. Has anyone else had this issue?Additionally, weâ€™re using a priority queue and not relying on ticks for FCFS.lab3
