Question: 
    Failing 19-21I am passing all the other clone test cases but failing the security ones. I have already checked in stack is null, if the stack size is large enough to hold the parents stack and if allocproc fails. I am checking this in proc.c. I am only allocproc if the inputs are valid. I am not sure what else to do.lab3
