    Do we need to hash the username?1) title (i know this may be a design choice, but is hashed usernames graded? the system is still secure if you only hash the password.)2) additionally, do we need to use both aes and sha256? I only used sha to hash with a salt, I didnt find a use for aes in my design.lab4
