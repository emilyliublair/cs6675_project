Question: 
    Test Case 25Does anyone know what test case 25 is checking for? I have looked through other threads about test cases for part3: login system and implemented isolated usage of the functions in login_lib.c which helped me pass some of the other test cases. I am now stuck on getting test case 25 to pass when my login system seems to be working.lab4

    Student Answer: 
    You can look at init.c to see how it launches the shell. What you do in login should be very similar~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
