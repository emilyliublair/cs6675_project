Question: 
    Launching shell on loginWhen the username and passwords match I call setuid and next want to launch shell. I see that login shouldn’t return if successful so this launch would need to happen in the function. I am not sure how to, is it like calling exec(shell) or smth?lab4

    Instructor Answer: 
    This looks like some sort of undefined behavior in your implementation. I don’t think we can help you much without actually seeing your code. Make sure you are not overflowing any buffers or accessing invalid regions of memory.
