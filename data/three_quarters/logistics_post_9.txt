Question: 
    Security 2 Lecture RecordingIs there a recording for the second security lecture, I don't think its on canvas anywhere and it would be very helpful to review for the exam.logistics

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    the guest speaker decided NOT to record the lecture.Of course it's always helpful, but I think it's worth reminding the students that providing video recordings is NOT required or mandated by the syllabus or the institute. It's done in a best effort fashion to aid the students to the best of our ability.
