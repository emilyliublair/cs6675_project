Question: 
    Submission SpecificationsWhen running scripts/submit.sh, is the code compiled in debug mode or a different mode, which would require us to make sure it compiles and runs as expected in that mode?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    That script just makes a zip file of all the source code. For autograded labs, your code will be compiled in release mode when you submit it to Gradescope, but lab 0 will be handgraded. You should make sure that your programs behave properly under both configurations to double check that there is no undefined behavior.
