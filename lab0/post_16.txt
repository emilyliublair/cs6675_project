Question: 
    Executable Files Disappeared in xv6I was working on Maximum Number of Files Per Directory, and the program crashed because the maximum number of files in the directory was exhausted. I terminated the program, but when I re-attached docker and ran my files again they would not execute.lab0

    Student Answer: 
    to reset your filesystem (which may or may not be a solution for your scenario) run "make clean" this is how i have been resetting my filesystem while trying to test maximum number of files in a dir (also specifically this is just removing the fs.img which i believe is your current entire file system)i think your actual root cause is that after the panic your OS might be in a bad state because of the overflow of files in that directory so resetting your filesystem should fix it~ An instructor (Rohan Natansh Bafna) endorsed this answer ~
