Question: 
    Extracredit Out of inodesWhen running my program for extra credit to calculate the maximum number of files in a directory I'm hitting the limit of inodes set in the operating system and am not able to stress the number of files that can be in a directory. Should I increase the maximum number of inodes or is this the limit I should be hitting?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    I received this response on a private piazza post:You may print out the number of files that are being generated as the program is being run. We will clarify this.
