Question: 
    submit.sh not working?I am trying to run submit.sh but I get an error message saying permission denied. It also appears that I do not have execute privileges because when I run 'ls -lart' it says the privileges are read only for me.Can this be fixed?lab0

    Run chmod +x scripts/submit.sh . This should give you execute permissions on the script.
