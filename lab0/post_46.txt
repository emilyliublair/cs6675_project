Question: 
    Is there a %cr1 control register?In the appendix of the textbook it states that the control registers are %cr0, %cr2, %cr3, and %cr4. Is there just not a %cr1 register or is that a typo? If there isn't a %cr1 register, why?lab0

    Student Answer: 
    It’s intentional, interestingly. x86 reserves %cr1, seehttps://wiki.osdev.org/CPU_Registers_x86-64#Control_Registers. I don’t believe the “why” is publicly known, seehttps://www.pagetable.com/?p=364.~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) endorsed this answer ~
