Question: 
    Little v Big Endian e820When the e820 call stores our 8-byte length and physical address, I believe it does so inLittle Endianordering. That's what it appears based on my inspection of memory, butcan anyone verify?I couldn't explicitly find anything within the bios call docs or xv6 manual regarding endianness.lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    Thatâ€™s correct.Some more context: most  (if not all) x86 architectures are little endian. Also, most modern systems are little endian because with pointer to some piece of data you can access a smaller type without any additional logic.
