Question: 
    Part 3 Contiguous Memory AllocationI'm currently able to pass all the tests in Gradescope, but realized my implementation assumes that the memory is allocated contiguously. That means I basically just verify that the e280 record is of type 1 and has a starting address within external memory. If it is, then I add its amount of memory to a counter variable. Is this a safe assumption?lab1This private post is only visible to Instructors andEmily Liu
