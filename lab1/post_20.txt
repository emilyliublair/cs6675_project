Question: 
    Do P2V_WO and V2P_WO do the same thing?I've been using both and they both seem to give me the same result according to GDB. They both add 0x80000000 to the address. Is this intentional, and are we required to use these functions for lab 1?For example, 0x7e000000 is translated to 0xfe000000 for both P2V_WO and V2P_WO.lab1

    Student Answer: 
    #define V2P_WO(x) ((x) - KERNBASE)#define P2V_WO(x) ((x) + KERNBASE)V2P should subtract 0x8000_0000, but it the underflow results in the same behavior as adding.~ An instructor (Elton Leander Pinto) endorsed this answer ~
