Question: 
    Base pointer higher than 0xF00Hi as I'm doing some testing for backtrace, I'm often getting values for the base pointer that are larger than 0xF00. For example, I recently got a base pointer of0x801380c8. To me this makes no sense, because I thought the stack had to grow downwards, which would mean that every base pointer should belessthan 0xF00. Am I missing something?lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    So the first EBP isn’t information that’s really used in the function call stack. This is because the EBPs on the stack are references to old stack frames, so the first EBP is technically a reference to nothing, because it represents the first function call (i.e. there are no older values). The value xF00 is simply something we added to the kernel to make it easy for you to know when you reached the bottom of the stack. The first real EBP value gets populated after this first function call. So, after xF00, you should see some address in the range of x80000000, and then these will go downwards in future function calls, as you correctly pointed out.
