Question: 
    Expected Output Tests 4-7I found a Wikipedia article detailing a "typical" outputÂ  of records from an E820 call. The struct I'm iterating over is nearly identical, except for one of the records entries. Is this an issue with my do_e820 call, or is it expected to have some difference(s)? Should this be the standard we strive for when debugging in gdb? Can this difference lead to "incorrect output" and "timeout" errors in the autograder?lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    The e820 records that you get in xv6 are provided by qemu's BIOS; they don't have to be (and probably aren't) the same as whatever example you found on Wikipedia.
