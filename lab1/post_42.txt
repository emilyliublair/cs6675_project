Question: 
    PrintingHow can we print the backtrace if there's no printf or echo exposed in kernel space?lab1

    Instructor Answer: 
    You’re right –printfandechoare part of a user-space library that implement file printing for any user program. Luckily, kernel-space also has its own function to print to the console calledcprintf. You can use this function anywhere and find its declaration inkernel/src/console.c. This function is built specifically for printing to the console (hence the “c”), so you don’t need to pass in a file descriptor as you would with user space’sprintf.

    @81_f1Anonymous Mouse2 months agoI see thatstdio.hcontains declarations for bothcprintfandfprintf, with the latter looking like theprintfthat a user program calls. I’m wondering why a kernel program can callcprintf, but notfprintf? I can see thatfprintfdoes not have a definition, at least none that vscode can find. But if so, why include this declaration at all?0Anonymous Mouse2 months agoI’m also a bit confused about howprintfin user space is implemented. I assumed it would make a sys call which would reachprintfmtor something similar, but from the source code I only see a call made towrite, which also seems to not have a visible definition.Basically, what’s the general flow of data when a user program callsprintf?0
