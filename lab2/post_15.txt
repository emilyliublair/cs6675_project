Question: 
    Running Usertests.cHow can I run usertest.c? Is it ran from inside xv6? When I run 'ls' inside xv6, I cannot see it, nor do I see a usertests executable in the build directory.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    Ended up figuring it out. You add usertests.c and echo.c to the CMakeLists.txt and make. When you ls, you should see it there now.

Thank you, I’ll remember it for next lab0
