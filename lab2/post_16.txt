Question: 
    Getting incorrect output on test 10My forktest output matches, I am passing all tests in usertest.c and all tests on the auto grader except for test 10 where I get the "incorrect output" error. Does anyone know what functionality test 10 tests or have any ideas on how to debug the issue?lab2
