Question: 
    about kalloc and kfreein kfree(char *v), is v a virtual or physical address? from my understanding kalloc returns a physical address (allocates one page of physical memory), so from my understanding v should be a physical address, but in kfree() it has "V2P(v)", so maybe my understanding is completely off.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    I think both the pointer returned from kalloc and v in kfree are located in virtual memory (since they are both variables in the kernel which operates in high memory after early initialization)Â such that v - KERNBASE is the start of the physical page it is pointing to (see how freelist is initialized from kinit[1/2] -> freerange -> kfree). So it seems both are virtual.~ An instructor (Alexa Suzanne Fazio) endorsed this answer ~
