Question: 
    `usertests` isn't running as expected (stops early)This is my output whenever I run `usertests` in my console (the file is unchanged from the repo).From my analysis of the code it looks like it's stopping early because I don't even see "usertests starting", but I step through it in GDB and see no issues. Is there a reason why this might be happening?Also might be worth noting that many of my tests time out in Gradescope (tests 2-11, to be specific). I was running usertests.c in an effort to help diagnose why I'm getting timeouts. Any advice here would be helpful.lab2

    Student Answer: 
    I think I found that some of the user tests dont really work for testing and that any calls after it won't really work because it leaves you in a bad state. I wouldn't really recommend using the usertests for this lab. If you try running this in the base lab2 branch you'll see that the test also ends early and causes bad state

    @274_f1Varoon Sai Kodithala1 month agoSome more context here: the last faulting page has virtual address 0x1000, which is the guard page and should not be writable.I added in logic in my trap handler for page faults such that trying to write to a page without PTE_U set would cause the page fault handler to be exited, but the issue with my usertests stopping persists.0@274_f2Anonymous Atom1 month agoWhat did you use to debug this then? We are still failing some test cases and it's getting hard to determine how exactly to check our implementation0Varoon Sai Kodithala1 month agoNot sure how to debug without writing my own test cases, that's why I'm asking here haha.My next step will probably be to write my own test cases though to test CoW/zero paging functionality.0Anonymous Calc1 month agoI used usertests to debug but my solution that passed the gradescope tests only passed up till the opentest.It was helpful for me to debug the last issue I had.0Anonymous Calc1 month agoNevermind, it should pass through opentest as well, I just forgot to include echo.c in my sources.cmake file.0@274_f3Varoon Sai Kodithala1 month agoAnyone know why my code might be trying to read from the guard page? This would be helpful in debugging.0Anonymous Calc1 month agoDo you get the proper PTE in the trap handler?0
