Question: 
    Should we be passing any autograder tests with a working COW fork implementation only?I currently have a working Part 1 (COW fork) implementation that allows me to boot into xv6 without any apparent issues and also perfectly matches the output in forktest_expected_cow.out. However, I'm still failing every test case on Gradescope with a "Test failed: incorrect output" message. Is this normal (since I haven't done Part 2 yet) or should I expect to pass some cases with just Part 1 implemented?lab2

    Student Answer: 
    Yes according to@221my group also had this and for some of the tests we were printing stuff we shouldnâ€™t when killing processes.
