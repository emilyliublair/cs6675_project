Question: 
    TLB invalidate specificationsWhat param does the invlpg function accept? Is it a virtual address, and does it have to be left shifted to be 32 bits? Or is it the pte?lab2

    Student Answer: 
    seems like it should be a virtual address as a void pointer~ An instructor (Sukrit Kumar) endorsed this answer ~

    Instructor Answer: 
    think about what TLB is, it's a map, mapping what? VFN to pte, right? So it takes something that can be translated to a VFN on input. A virtual address will do.
