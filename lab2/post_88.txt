Question: 
    Lab 2 cprintfIn lab 1, we had a more fleshed out cprintf that supported all format types of stdio's printf, but in lab 2, cprintf only supports %d, %x, %p, %s. Can we copy lab 1's cprintf into lab 2 or possibly future labs?lab2

    I don’t think you’ll ever need that extra functionality, but feel free to do so if you wish.
