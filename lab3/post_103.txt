Question: 
    does wait() return if there is an exited child thread?Since waitpid(pid) waits for the process/thread with id = pid, does this mean wait() also waits for children threads in addition to children processes? Or does wait() only exists if there is an exited child process?lab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    Wait() should also wait for child threads.
