Question: 
    Part 1, tests 1-3Our scheduling code is failing tests 1-3 as well as 9 for part 1, and we aren't sure what is causing this. We have tested that the scheduler properly prioritizes based on fifo/rr, priority level, etc. We've also tested that it does preempt, but we're worried we've missed a situation in which it should yield. Any recommendations for what to check or test?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    Tests 1-3 check default round robin behaviors (eg does your process yield after one time quantum)Test 9 checks if your process yields when you set a child with a higher priority than you.This is based on my own experience with the autograder, so it may not fully encompass everything that it tests for. But it should be a good place to start.
