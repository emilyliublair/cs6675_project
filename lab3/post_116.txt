Question: 
    Part 5 Nits: Should mutex still function without setpark()?If a user decides not to use setpark(), should you return a -1 (error out), or should the park/unpark mechanism still function properly?If the second case is the desired behavior, wouldn't setpark be unnecessary?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    If a user doesnâ€™t use setpark(), then park() and unpark() should still function properly (i.e. they should put a process to sleep and wake it up), but the lost wakeup problem might happen.
