    Instructor Answer: 
    good catch, lab spec corrected. Only one gradescope assignment for lab3. The checkpoint bonus will be calculated by the autograder script based on the percentage of tests 1-21 passed by the deadline (per the updated spec).I will make an announcement about this in class. So stay tuned.
