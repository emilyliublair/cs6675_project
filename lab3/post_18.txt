Question: 
    Waitpid on grandchildrenCan waitpid() be called on grandchildren? If a process calls clone to create a child, which then calls clone, can the original process call waitpid on the grandchild?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    waitpid should only work on children, I don't think the waitpid test checks for grandchildren. For waitpid make sure that the pid we're waiting on is a direct child (i.e currproc.pid == waiting_pid.parent)
