Question: 
    Handgrading Tips?Hi,Since the deadline is coming up for lab 3, I thought I'd ask if anyone has any specific tips on what to look out for regarding the handgraded portion of the lab. With so much code written, it's probably easy to miss stuff like locking a data structure.For example, should we be park/release the mutex atomically for conditional variables?lab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    For me, using the search feature in VSCode to look across all uses of shared variables is the best at identifying missed locking. As far as mutex correctness is concerned, consider all possible interleaving of instructions to the mutex acquire and release in order to identify atomicity issues, as covered in lab (since for example after checking a particular resource is held, the process might be switched out and when returned to the sameplace, the resource might no longer be held).
