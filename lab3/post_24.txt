Question: 
    Autograder Timing OutThe autograder timed out after 45ish minutes - what do we do in this case?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    It's been timing out for me as well and I don't think its my fault as earlier tonight, I had a TA re-run my submission and it ran correctly the second time. Maybe it has to do with a lot of people submitting right now.

    Instructor Answer: 
    Have triggered a re-run
