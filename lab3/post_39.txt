Question: 
    Can waitpid only wait on child?In the Part 2 description, it’s clear that the intended use forwaitpidis for a parent to be able to wait on a specific child thread. However, it wasn’t explicitly stated whether this is the only situation wherewaitpidshould allow itself to be used. Can any process wait on any process usingwaitpid, or shouldwaitpidonly permit A to wait on B if A is B’s parent?Thankslab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    Yes we should only wait for children proc in wait pid. If the proc calling waitpid has no children there is no point going to sleep, we can just return -1 and exit out of waitpid
