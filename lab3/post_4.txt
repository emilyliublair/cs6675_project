Question: 
    thread createI know this is very last minute, but can anyone give me the general way of thinking about thread_create? ive been stuck on it for some time now and i think i might be going in the wrong direction.I know you're supposed to malloc then clone, but when i call clone i get a panic (even though i pass all the clone tests)lab3

    Student Answer: 
    Getting a kernel panic seems like there is an issue with your clone because userspace should not be causing the kernel to panic
