Question: 
    ParksWhen we have unpark -> park, should this be considered lost forever or should we make it so that park() doesnâ€™t park after this?For setpark -> unpark -> setpark -> park, should park() park or not?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Setpark->unpark sets the process to a lost wakeup state. If you setpark again, it should go back to an intending to sleep state. If you actually park after that, the process should go to sleep

    @537_f1Anonymous Calc6 days agoi have another related question. if you just straight up call park and nothing else, should you expect the process to just sleep and never come back?0Pau Sum6 days agoIf t1 parks and t2 unparks t1, assuming that t1 had enough time to go to sleep, t2 should be able to wake up t1. If t1 did not fully go to sleep yet and t2 tries to wake it up, you have a lost wakeup problem.But to actually answer your question, if you just call park and nothing else, the thread should sleep. It could be woken up by another thread that calls unpark, it could not. Depends on if you got unlucky and got lost wakeup issue. Hope that helps!good comment1
