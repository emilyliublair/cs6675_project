Question: 
    Spinlock requirementsDoes the userspace spinlock need to ensure that a thread wonâ€™t be starved while trying to acquire the lock, or is it sufficient to ensure mutual exclusion?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    By starved do you mean a user thread tried to acquire a spinlock but never does because another thread that has the lock never releases? This livelock is an issue of the userland programmer. It should be sufficient to ensure mutual exclusion.
