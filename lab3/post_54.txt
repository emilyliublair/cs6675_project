Question: 
    Clone Return ValueMy clone function isn't returning 0 in the child even after setting the np->tf->eax to 0. I'm checking this with an if statement similar to how fork tests work. Is there something I'm obviously missing? I've tried stepping through in GDB but haven't been able to find anything that is obviously wrong, the proc just gets cleaned up in exit and never performs the print statements inside the child pid check. I'm also passing all of the clone cases except 12.lab3

    The address housing 0xfff... is the top of the user stack

    @514_f1Anonymous Poet1 week agoThat's what I thought. Just wanted to be sure.0@514_f2Anonymous Helix7 days agoI don’t think the student response is true. Look at argc/argv parameters pushed onto the stack in exec; they should be deeper into the stack than the return address (0xffff…) and should be preserved in the cloned thread.0Pau Sum7 days agoYes above the return address for main, there are arguments for main. You do not have to worry about copying these though. Check figure 2-3 in the xv6 manual for more details.good comment2
