Question: 
    Waitinfo fails test 7After implementing waitinfo, I now fail test 7 (pass all other test). My locking order is ptable.lock then tickslock (consistently, to avoid deadlocking). I saw@534has the same issue. Has anyone else had this issue?Additionally, weâ€™re using a priority queue and not relying on ticks for FCFS.lab3

    @610_f1Anonymous Gear23 hours agoI'm pretty confident waitinfo is not used in test 7, did you modify anything with the scheduler for the extra credit? Maybe something in the queue while handling SCHED_OTHER?0Anonymous Mouse23 hours agoYup, solved it by reverting back to my old implementation and adding it back little by little. Also, due to how sleep is written and used, I had to switch the lock order from ptable.lock -> tickslock to tickslock-> ptable.lock, or getting the ticks value (within locks) outside of ptable.lock.0
