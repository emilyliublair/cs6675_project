Question: 
    Unpark return valueIf a process has called setpark on the chan then unpark changes the state of the process to the lost wakeup state, I assume unpark should return but should it return 0 because no processes were worken up or 1 because one process was made so it wouldn't sleep?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    You should return 1. This helped us pass test case 35 today!~ An instructor (Pau Sum) endorsed this answer ~
