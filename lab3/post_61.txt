Question: 
    Any tips for testcase 35?I have heard that this is testing the lost wakeup problem. I have tried:simple setpark, unpark, park test (does not get stuck)the sequence mentioned in@406(does not get stuck)seemingly complete state machineQuestions:If park sees that setpark was called, and then unpark was called before park, should it return -1 or 0?If you do setpark back to back, should you return 0 or -1?what is the expected behaiour if no calls to setpark are made and unpark is called before park? should we sleep or remember the earlier unpark and immediately return?lab3

    @504_f1Anonymous Atom1 week agoNot sure if this is related but I think you should only unpark one process that has called setpark on the same channel, instead of every one of them, else unpark is technically waking up more than one process.We just don't want the wake up signal to be lost so it just has to be received by at most one process. The signal should not be broadcasted.I return 0 for back to back setpark calls and I'm able to pass test 35.0@504_f2Nathan Prashant Duggal5 days agoCan you give some additional detail on what we can look for to find similar problems to what you experienced?1
