Question: 
    Failing 19-21I am passing all the other clone test cases but failing the security ones. I have already checked in stack is null, if the stack size is large enough to hold the parents stack and if allocproc fails. I am checking this in proc.c. I am only allocproc if the inputs are valid. I am not sure what else to do.lab3

    Instructor Answer: 
    What if the stack pointer passed in to clone is a kernel space pointer? Do you check for that?Also, are you verifying that the user stack passed in is valid? For example, think about how a user space process could get the kernel to dereference a kernel space pointer stored on its stack.

    @448_f1Andrew Boeger2 weeks agoI've seen discussions about memory it "absolutely cannot be in" and people mention Kernel space, but why would you check for that? It should instantly page fault of out that and die.The whole point of page faults is that you don't care if someone tries to pass around a Kernel address, you block access at the trap/PTE level - not the function level.EDIT: I thought about passing in a kernel space ptr as the stack ptr in clone(), which the sys_call handles at the kernel level, so it wouldn't trigger a trap.0
