Question: 
    Locking file system operationsI'm currently working on maintaining atomicity for individual file system read/write operations. Since we use argfd to check whether the process has the file open, I am assuming we need to keep this atomic with the read/write to ensure that another process in the same thread group doesn't close the file after argfd.I'm having issues with with sleeps in filewrite from end_op and writei, but if I release the lock and re-acquire, I keep running into panics. Am I approaching this the right way in terms of needing to hold a lock for file system reads/writes or overcomplicating it?lab3

    Student Answer: 
    After looking into this more, it seems like this issue is actually for the user program to avoid if needed, since it wouldn't affect the correctness of the kernel.
