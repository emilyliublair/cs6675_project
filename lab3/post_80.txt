Question: 
    How well do we need to clean the stack* that the user provides?What happens if the new stack* for clone is pointing to the guard page? Should we allow the process to crash / get killed via a trap or should clone fail and return -1lab3

    Student Answer: 
    

    Instructor Answer: 
    Don’t overcomplicate the security checks you need to do here. For example, if it’s pointing to the guard page, the program will page fault and get killed anyway when it’s accessed. Just think about which sections of memory it absolutely cannot be in.
