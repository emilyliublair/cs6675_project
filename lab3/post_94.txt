Question: 
    Test Failed: Make FailureAfter implementing Part 1, I tried running the autograder but keep getting make failure. I've tried implementing stubs for the following syscalls as perhttps://piazza.com/class/m5l90em6d0u656/post/332:clonewaitpidparksetparkunparkwaitinfoIs there anything I'm missing?lab3

    Have you tried building in release mode?

    @398_f1Anonymous Atom3 weeks agoYep, it successfully builds in release mode too locally. Just to confirm, we set the release mode flag by calling before running make?cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release0Elton Leander Pinto3 weeks agoHave you tested clone locally?good comment0Anonymous Atom3 weeks agoNot yet, I haven't done part 2 yet. Do I need to implement it to test part 1?0Anonymous Atom3 weeks agoFixed this, the solution is to ensure you are adding the stubbed syscalls to the userspace as well.0Anonymous Comp3 weeks agoCan you explain what the fix was? I'm getting this same issue and I can't tell why. Do we need to do anything in /user besides adding the syscall prototypes in user.h and using the macro in usys.S to make the user-space wrapper for the syscall? I tried writing my own userspace program that uses setscheduler and waitpid and that compiles fine in release mode, so I don't really understand why i'm getting make failure still on gradescope.0Mwenda Mbui2 weeks agoDid you ever resolve the issue?0Anonymous Atom1 week agoDid you stub waitinfo?0Anonymous Helix6 days agoIs there a solution to this issue that was found?0Anonymous Comp6 days agoFor me, the issue was that I was missing a stub for the clone syscall. I thought I had made stubs for all of them but I simply missed clone. Just make sure you have stubs for every single syscall in the whole lab -- the test cases are trying to compile userspace calls to all of the syscalls used in the lab, so if you don't have a stub for one of the syscalls, it will fail to compile.0
