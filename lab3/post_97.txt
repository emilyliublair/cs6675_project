Question: 
    Pt 3 threads Error/Security/Address SpaceI've been working on the thread_create and thread_wait implementation and I'm passing all the general and I/O blocking cases, but I am failing every error/security case and the address space case.I'm wondering if anyone has any intuition that I may be missing.I'm guessing the error/security tests relate to different edge cases. I've checked the the function pointer in thread_create is not null and that he pid in thread_wait is non-negative, but I'm not sure if the problem lies in argument sanitization since the system calls clone() and waitpid() check the args in kernel-space.Also, what sort of behavior might we be checking relating to the thread address space? clone() handles the same page directory aspect in the kernel, but what do we need to do in the user space to enable this behavior for threads?Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!lab3

    Student Answer: 
    pid must be positive not just non-negative

    @393_f1Anonymous Beaker3 weeks agoDoes anyone know if Thread Library Error/Security tests 27-30 and Thread Address Space test 31 should be passing with just thread_create and thread_wait implemented correctly or do we have to have all of the functions in thread.c implemented for these to pass?0@393_f2Anonymous Comp2 weeks agoAny updates on this?0Anonymous Beaker2 weeks agoCheck out note number@4620
